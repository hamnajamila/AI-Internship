The US president is a heavyweight negotiator, and the Madame President is a featherweight.”Orban said. “The American agreement with the UK is much better than this. The European agreement is worse than the English one. Therefore, it will be difficult to claim it as a success later on.”Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto echoed Orban’s criticism, saying the developments underscored the need for new leadership in Brussels.‘Submissive diplomacy’The Hungarian leader, who has long aligned himself with Trump and often clashes with EU leadership, made the remarks during a domestic political event, where he also reiterated his opposition to deeper EU integration and what he called the Commission’s “submissive diplomacy.”Neither the European Commission nor the Trump administration has responded publicly to Orban’s remarks.Von der Leyen has not commented directly on the trade talks or Orban’s criticisms, though her office previously defended the negotiations as part of efforts to strengthen transatlantic economic ties.The EU and US have been working to stabilise their trade relationship after years of friction under the Trump administration, including disputes over tariffs and subsidies.Orban’s comments suggest that Trump’s return to the global stage, even unofficially, is already reshaping European political rhetoric."

And though President Trump's ratings are currently underwater, Democrats have yet to find their footing, let alone mount a compelling challenge.Arecent CNN pollreleased earlier this month found only 28 percent of Americans view the Democratic Partyfavourably— the lowest rating recorded by the outlet since it began polling the question in 1992.A newWall Street Journalpoll on July 25 delivered a further blow: 63 percent of voters now hold an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party, the highest inJournalpolling going back to 1990.Asking voters how they would vote in the midterms if they were held today, theJournalfound Democrats leading Republicans by 3 points — 46 to 43 percent.Voters aren't exactly warming to the GOP either, but that's little comfort.RelatedThe Democratic Party favorabilityThe Republican Party's net favourability, though negative, is less dire than the Democrats'.Even Trump himself is viewed more favourably than the party trying to unseat him.The problem runs deeper than bad press or scattered strategy. According to Democratic pollster John Anzalone, ""The Democratic brand is so bad that they don't have the credibility to be a critic of Trump or the Republican Party.""That credibility gap is now a chasm: one made worse by confusion within the party’s ranks.There is no unifying voice, no compelling narrative, and no consistent answer to what Democrats stand for.Scott Tranter, Director of data science atDecision Desk HQ, puts it plainly: ""It’s pretty clear that Schumer is not the guy, just based on his approval rating.""View post on X""Out of touch and weak""Even Democrats' recent wins in local and state elections haven't translated into a national resurgence. Instead, voters are labelling them with bruising words like out of touch and weak.That's how they showed up in a recent internal poll by Democratic super PACUnite the Country: a brutal self-assessment from within the trenches.The partyhas seen its support erodewith white men, Hispanic men, and working-class voters across the board.Experts say that Democrats need to show that they're hearing people's concerns and actively offering solutions to those concerns to make their lives better and more affordable, but that is not happening.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and fellow Democrats outside the US Capitol.AnAP-NORCpoll found that only a third of Democrats feel optimistic about their party’s future, a sharp drop from 57 percent this time last year.Meanwhile, more voters are now identifying as Republicans than Democrats, and the GOP holds a growing financial edge.The erosion of Democratic trust isn't new. It's a slow bleed: decades of missed moments, muddled messages, and competing factions inside the party. But under Trump 2.0, the urgency has returned. And still, many Democrats are fumbling for a megaphone.This week, as the House began its summer recess, Democrats fanned out across the country to host town halls, some in Republican districts, hoping to stir the kind of backlash energy that lit up Trump’s first term.Their aim: to call out Trump’s agenda and style of governance. But with no standout messenger and no cohesive story, it's not clear whether voters are tuning in.RelatedTRT Global - Trump threatens Musk with 'very serious consequences' if he funds Democrats""No single leader or single messenger""Stephen Farnsworth, Professor of Political Science and Director at the University of Mary Washington’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies, toldTRT Worldthat the GOP has simply won the messaging war.""Republicans have been much better at painting the Democrats as out of touch than the reverse.""It's not just what's said, he argues. It's where and how it's said.""Democrats have no comparable television and online platform to compete withFox News,"" Farnsworth noted.""And they have no single leader or single messenger to compete with the president for shaping the narrative. That's the nature of being out of power at the White House and in Congress.""Even on issues where Democrats might expect traction, such as Trump’s past associations with Jeffrey Epstein — Farnsworth says Republicans are seizing the mic first.""Even Trump’s current problems with the Epstein files have as much to do with Republican efforts as Democratic messages.""Interestingly, midterms (taking place next year) have traditionally punished the party in power, a pattern that, on paper, should favour the Democrats.McInturff, a Republican pollster, notes that five successive presidents have lost control of Congress, including former President Barack Obama, whose party lost 63 seats in the Tea Party surge in the first election after he took office.With their approval numbers sinking and their message unclear, Democrats can at least take some comfort in this: the midterms have a habit of humbling the party in power.And that rule hasn't broken yet.RelatedTRT Global - Supreme Court allows Trump to fire 3 Democrats from consumer safety commission"

At the same time, James Zimmerman, a lawyer in Beijing and former chairman of American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China), noted that the legal tool has existed since the 1980s.RelatedTRT Global - Advantage China: Why Trump’s tariff gamble could backfire on the USTwo Americans blocked from leaving ChinaThe US State Departmentconfirmedon July 22 that a US Patent and Trademark Office employee has been barred from leaving China for over three months. The man,also a US Army veteran, reportedlyfailed to declarehis government affiliation on a visa application.According toThe New York Times,the employee travelled to Chengdu, the capital city of China’s southwestern Sichuan province, in April to visit family but was intercepted by Ministry of State Security (MSS) officers. The report stated that the MSS officers seized his passport, credit card, and personal devices and interrogated him about his military service maintaining Black Hawk helicopters. Although his passport was later returned, he has been barred from leaving.Shortly before, Mao Chenyue, a Shanghai-born US citizen and Wells Fargo managing director, was placed under an exit ban while on a business trip to China. She has been unable to return to the US, and Wells Fargo has sincesuspendedall employee travel to China.China’s Foreign MinistryconfirmedMao’s travel restriction, saying it was part of a “criminal investigation,” but declined to provide details. “Everyone in China, whether Chinese or foreign, must abide by Chinese laws,” said spokesperson Guo Jiakun.RelatedTRT Global - ‘China responded to US bullying, but door to dialogue wide open’Legal tool or political leverage?Chinese authorities argue that exit bans are lawful tools used to support investigations, prevent flight risks, and uphold national security.“Exit bans are commonly used in investigations to prevent witnesses or suspects viewed as flight risks from exiting mainland China,” Zimmerman toldTRT World.“Most of the time, there is a legitimate legal basis, but there are indeed instances of misuse, including for political reasons,” he noted.Tangen, on the other hand, asserted that “China upholds the rule of law and handles entry and exit affairs in accordance with legal procedures,” adding that similar practices exist in the US, EU, and UK.“Chinese nationals have faced prosecution abroad for offences ranging from money laundering to cyber espionage. Legal accountability crosses borders.”Zimmerman acknowledged the legal framework but pointed to concerns over a lack of transparency and “the absence of a workable bail system” that makes lifting an exit ban difficult.He also highlighted the rising use of exit bans by China’s Central Commission on Disciplinary Inspection (CCDI) in corruption probes, including those involving foreign-linked firms or executives with past connections to Chinese government officials or state-owned enterprises.Daniels, meanwhile, emphasised the ambiguity around how individuals become targets. “Americans doing business in China are now being caught in the crossfire and subject to China’s extremely opaque legal system,” she warned. “Without real due process, there is always an open question that detentions of Americans in China are state-directed to build leverage with the US government.”“It’s difficult to build a good risk mitigation strategy because it’s not clear how one becomes a target for an exit ban,” she said. “More transparency would help prevent a chilling effect on business travel.”RelatedTRT Global - How serious is China’s warning to ‘fight till the end’ with the US?Espionage case fuels speculationThe exit bans came just as Chinese-American engineer Chenguang Gong pleaded guilty in California to stealing over 3,600 sensitive files intended for military use, according to aJustice Department statementreleased on July 21.US authorities said Gong had ties to Chinese “talent programs” and proposed developing military-grade infrared and radar technology for Beijing.While some observers speculate a retaliatory link between Gong’s case and China’s recent imposition of exit bans on two Americans, both Tangen and Zimmerman cautioned against drawing conclusions.“Beijing would likely reject any suggestion that these cases are linked,” said Tangen.However, Tangen also cited past cases such as that of Canada’s‘Two Michaels’—Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig—who were arrested in China on espionage charges in 2018 and later released in 2021, following Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou freed by Canada in what was dubbed as“hostage diplomacy.”“The blanket denials from the Canadian government eventually turned out to be false. It later emerged one was an asset and the other his handler,” he said.“To put things in perspective,” he added, “the US, viaCIA, and British security servicesMI5 and MI6have openly advertised for Mandarin-speaking spies over the internet. If there is a question of spying, Beijing will react as Washington or any other jurisdiction.”RelatedTRT Global - As Trump 2.0 targets China, 2025 could spiral into a new Cold WarCorporate fallout: Travel warnings and device restrictionsThe latest exit bans have sent shockwaves through the US corporate sector.

Especially in a remote mountainous region, which sits right on top of an active seismic belt.The Yarlung Tsangpo River transforms into the Brahmaputra as it flows downstream into northeast India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states, before entering Bangladesh, where it is known as the Jamuna.Why is it significantWhile Beijing touts the project as a green energy breakthrough, authorities in India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states are raising alarm over potential catastrophic effects downstream.Arunachal’s Chief MinisterPema Khandu warnedthat the dam could lead to the drying up of the Siang and Brahmaputra rivers, or worse, function as a ""water bomb"" if China were to release water suddenly.Similar concerns have also been expressed byBangladeshi officials, who earlier in February this year sent a formal request to Beijing for more information on the project’s environmental impact assessment and feasibility study.The Brahmaputra basin—stretching across India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, and into Bangladesh—is one of the most flood-prone regions in the world, with seasonal deluges causing widespread devastation and thousands of deaths nearly every year.In Assam, the Brahmaputra River is not just a lifeline but the primary source of irrigation, sustaining the state’s agrarian economy. Fears that China’s newly launched mega-dam upstream could alter the natural flow or trigger sudden water discharges have intensified concerns about the impact on the region.Further fuelling concerns are environmental and seismic risks. The Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon is located in a high-altitude, earthquake-prone zone, raising fears about the potential for dam collapse or structural failure.It’s interesting to note that the Indian and Bangladeshi governments have not yet officially commented on the project since work started on it.Brief backgrounderChina hasn’t officially shared details about the design. It’s unclear if this would be a massive run-of-the-river project that involves multiple small dams and power plants or if long tunnels would be dug through the Namcha Barwa mountain to force water from higher to lower regions to generate electricity.Yarlung Tsangpo flows through what is said to be the world’s deepest and longest land canyon. The project will be built in a region where the river falls 2,000 meters within a short stretch of 50 kilometres, making it an ideal site for power production.Beijing hasn’t indicated that it wants to use the project for agricultural purposes. This point is important. Generally, lower riparian countries fear that water will be blocked, badly affecting the farm output.While the Yarlung Tsangpo originates in China, most of the water it eventually discharges—as it becomes the Brahmaputra downstream—is contributed by catchment areas within India.RelatedTRT Global - China dams to be discussed in India visit of Jake SullivanResearchshows that while nearly 50 percent of the Yarlung Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River basin lies within Chinese territory, it contributes only a fraction of the river’s total discharge.According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)report, China accounts for about 30 percent of the Brahmaputra’s flow, though otherstudiessuggest the figure could be as low as seven percent.What happens nextIn response to the perceived threat of the new Chinese mega-dam, India is moving tofast-track the construction of its own hydropower damon the river on its side. It wants to use it as a buffer against sudden water discharges from China.In a recentmeeting, Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar asked his Chinese counterpart forcooperation on trans-border rivers.China and India don’t have a formal water treaty that allows close cooperation on how to use shared rivers.Trust between the two of the world’s most populous countries remains low, especially after the 2020 deadly military clash between Indian and Chinese forces over the disputed Himalayan border in Ladakh.While recent high-level talks between the two nations have indicated a desire to “gradually improve relations”, water security is now emerging as a long-term flashpoint in their bilateral ties."

Modern Israel is none of these,"" Burge tellsTRT World.Watch on YouTube'Narrow understanding of identity'Even if Evangelicals want to apply the verse to Abraham's descendants, that logic may have its own problems.The Torah makes a distinction between the blessings of Ishmael (the father of Arabs) and his brother Isaac.In it, the blessings of Abraham run uniquely through Isaac and Jacob (the prophet later known as Israel), but both Old and New Testament prophets reject this.""Because some people think the promises and blessings follow ethnic lines, then you must have the Jewish ethnicity to benefit from them,"" Burge says.""It is an ethnic argument. However, the OT (Old Testament) prophets and especially the NT (New Testament) reject this narrow understanding of identity,"" he adds.Many Jews in Israel today are of Ashkenazi descent.

A war veteran who struggled withalcohol abuseand abandoned his wife and children. A lawyer who resigned in disgrace afterbribery allegations. A man once jailed for forging his own sister's signature.Yet it was his reference Bible, peppered with unverified commentary, that helped embed the Israel-Genesis connection in American Evangelical consciousness.Jesse Wheeler, Associate Executive Director at Friends of Sabeel–North America: A Christian Voice for Palestine, calls it ""deeply problematic.""""The issue is less about the translation so much as the inclusion of Scofield’s notes/commentary within the pages of scripture and their elevation almost to the point of sacred text itself,"" Wheeler tellsTRT World.Reverend Wagner agrees.""This reference Bible includes a type of fundamentalist Christian theology called premillennial dispensationalism,"" he says. ""It implies God favours the Jewish people and a modern Israel that will be the location of the final prophetic events, such as the return of Jesus and the final battle between evil, the devil, and a militarised Israel.""""This is a human invention and is not consistent with the Hebrew prophets or Jesus’ life and teachings. In fact, Jesus rejects using the Bible or religious ideas to predict the future and particularly a militant interpretation of the final days.""Burge says, ""Very few evangelicals use it in the US. But it was a dispensational project that believed in the ethnic exclusivity of the Jews in the programme of God, and these things were inserted into its footnotes.""For Kuttab, the motivation for misreading the verse isn't theological — it's political.""Those who exclude not only Arabs, but also Christians from the label 'children of Abraham' do so for political reasons that have nothing to do with theology or religion,"" he says.RelatedTRT Global - Q&A: For every 1 Jewish Zionist, there are 30 Christian Zionists, and Netanyahu exploits this"

Davos was his court.The World Economic Forum — his creation, his brand, his stage — turned into a go-to conclave of capitalism where titans mingled with techies and heads of state brushed past climate activists.Now, Schwab finds himself at the centre of an internal investigation, one triggered by a whistleblower, steered by a Zurich law firm, and punctuated by whispers of intimidation, excess and impropriety. It's the first time the Forum's founder has become its most fragile liability.The 87-year-old German economist stepped down as executive chairman in April. The announcement, formal and measured, came with the dignity of a founder passing the torch. ""Throughout this journey,"" Schwab said in a written statement, ""Hilde and I never used the Forum for personal enrichment.""But behind the glassy calm of the Alpine summit, tensions had been building.The Swiss law firm Homburger was quietly brought in to lead a governance probe, after internal complaints alleged misconduct stretching back over a decade, including workplace bullying, inappropriate behaviour, and more than $1.1 million in questionable travel expenses.Preliminary findings reviewed byThe Wall Street Journaland Swiss paperSonntagsZeitungwere shared confidentially with Forum trustees this summer.View post on XThe expenses included luxury trips to the Seychelles, Morocco, and Miami, often with Schwab's wife Hilde, came with what investigators described as ""little or no evidence of business being involved.""Hilde chaired the Schwab Foundation but held no formal role within the WEF.Schwab, through a spokesman, ""broadly rejected the findings."" He went further, accusing the board of breaching confidentiality after parts of the probe surfaced in the press.""The board of trustees is in no way honouring the agreement reached on media restraint,"" he said in a statement. ""I feel deceived… I am not available for further investigations.""That line drew a red one between founder and forum. What began as a closed-door review now teeters on the edge of institutional rupture.""I am willing to defend my interests with all my strength,"" Schwabwarned, ""even in the context of a legal dispute.""At the heart of the probe is not just money or travel but culture, conduct, and power. Investigators cited a pattern of behaviour they described as overreaching.Schwab, they noted, acted as if the Forum were his ""fiefdom,"" often intervening in editorial publications, pressing staff, and directing benefits toward Hilde.Among the most sensitive allegations: gendered behaviour and inappropriate comments. One example cited in the report is a June 2020 suggestive email Schwab sent to a senior female staffer.RelatedTRT Global - Davos meeting founder Klaus Schwab steps down as WEF chairConflict of interestSchwab, through his spokesman, said the emails ""didn’t reflect his character."" He viewed the Forum,he added, ""like a family"" and saw himself as a ""father figure"" to many young staffers.But for some women — particularly those pregnant or over 40 — investigators said career paths were blocked, contributions sidelined, and morale battered.The picture echoes a 2023Wall Street Journalexpose,which described a ""toxic culture"" for women and Black employees. The new probe adds further weight and a paper trail.In one incident, Schwab allegedly pushed Forum researchers to revise content in the influentialGlobal Competitiveness Report. In another, investigators flagged a project at Villa Mundi, a lakeside property near Geneva, as a potential conflict of interest.Succession planning, too, has grown murkier. Schwab had intended to remain as chair until 2027.In May, he toldThe Financial Timesthat ECB President Christine Lagarde had ""discussed cutting short her term"" to take the helm. But that possibility now appears remote.In its only public statement since Schwab’s resignation, the Forum’s board chose to look back, not ahead: ""The Board acknowledged the outstanding achievements of the retired Chairman and Founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab. He created the leading global platform for dialogue and progress.""That platform now finds itself at a crossroads, confronting an air of uncertainty to its legacy and future trajectory.Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, the Forum’s vice chairman and former Nestlé CEO, has stepped in as interim chair. A search is underway for a permanent successor.But even as the legal review nears completion, with final recommendations expected by next month, the Forum's deeper challenge appears to be existential. Rebuilding trust. Reimagining leadership. And disentangling a global institution from the singular figure who defined it for more than 50 years."

According toAxios, Burchett ""did not consult Donald Trump beforehand.""Oversight Chair James Comer, who greenlit the move, also said he had not informed either Trump or House Speaker Mike Johnson.""She's the last one standing.

We’re owed that,"" Johnson added.Currently, the Speaker is holding off on any action related to the Epstein investigation, even as Republican lawmakers demand a vote. With the legislative schedule in disarray, he's sending the House into recess a day early for a month-long break.""There’s no purpose for the Congress to push an administration to do something they're already doing,"" Johnson said on Tuesday.Jeffrey Epstein, a financier with ties to global elites, was arrested in 2019 for sex trafficking and found dead weeks later in a New York jail, ruled a suicide. Ghislaine Maxwell, his associate, was later jailed for helping him abuse minors.For now, Maxwell remains in federal prison in Florida, serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking and conspiracy. But the legal fight isn’t over.US lawmakers have voted to subpoena Maxwell over Epstein's alleged “client list” as the story continues to grip Washington and dominate political chatter online.Her lawyers have petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing that her prosecution violated a non-prosecution agreement Epstein secured in 2008. The justices are expected to consider the case later this year.The question, presented in legalese but freighted with political weight, is whether a promise made by one federal prosecutor binds the entire Department of Justice.It’s the kind of arcane, procedural point that typically draws little attention outside legal circles. But in the context of Maxwell and Epstein, it may drag the scandal — and its political fallout — deep into the fall and beyond.Blanche was clear that the DOJ’s findings haven’t changed since the last public summary of the case.""No evidence was uncovered that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,""he said.But for those on the Hill, that’s not enough.“This (Maxwell) deposition will help the American people understand how Jeffrey Epstein was able to carry out his evil actions for so long without being brought to justice,” Burchett said in astatement.That tension between the official line and the undercurrent of distrust is now pushing the Epstein case out of the shadows again.RelatedTRT Global - Following 'Bondi-Bongino clash', MAGA activist warns Epstein files could harm Republicans in midterm"
