"25% of young children and pregnant women malnourished in Gaza, charity says, as PM vows to fly critical medical cases to UK",https://news.sky.com/story/25-of-young-children-and-pregnant-women-malnourished-in-gaza-charity-says-as-pm-vows-to-fly-critical-medical-cases-to-uk-13401950,,Author not found,"A charity has warned 25% of young children and pregnant women in Gaza are now malnourished, with Sir Keir Starmer vowing to evacuate children who need ""critical medical assistance"" to the UK.

MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said Israel's ""deliberate use of starvation as a weapon"" has reached unprecedented levels - with patients and healthcare workers both fighting to survive.

It claimed that, at one of its clinics in Gaza City, rates of severe malnutrition in children under five have trebled over the past two weeks - and described the lack of food and water on the ground as ""unconscionable"".

The charity also criticised the high number of fatalities seen at aid distribution sites, with one British surgeon accusing IDF soldiers of shooting civilians""almost like a game of target practice"".

MSF's deputy medical coordinator in Gaza, Dr Mohammed Abu Mughaisib, said: ""Those who go to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's food distributions know that they have the same chance of receiving a sack of flour as they do of leaving with a bullet in their head.""

The UN also estimates that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 people seeking food - the majority near the militarised distribution sites of the US-backed aid distribution scheme run by the GHF.

In a statement on Friday, the IDF had said it ""categorically rejects the claims of intentional harm to civilians"", andreports of incidents at aid distribution siteswere ""under examination"".

The GHFhas also previously disputedthat these deaths were connected with its organisation's operations, with director Johnnie Moore telling Sky News: ""We just want to feed Gazans. That's the only thing that we want to do.""

Israel says it has let enough food into Gaza and has accused the UN of failing to distribute it, in what the foreign ministry has labelled as ""a deliberate ploy"" to defame the country.

'Humanitarian catastrophe must end'

In a video message posted on X late last night, Sir Keir Starmer condemned the scenes in Gaza as ""appalling"" and ""unrelenting"" - and said ""the images of starvation and desperation are utterly horrifying"".

The prime minister added: ""The denial of aid to children and babies is completely unjustifiable, just as the continued captivity of hostages is completely unjustifiable.

""Hundreds of civilians have been killed while seeking aid - children, killed, whilst collecting water. It is a humanitarian catastrophe, and it must end.""

Sir Keir confirmed that the British government is now ""accelerating efforts"" to evacuate children from Gaza who need critical medical assistance, so they can be brought to the UK for specialist treatment.

Israel has now said that foreign countrieswill be able to airdrop aid into Gaza. While the PM says the UK will now ""do everything we can"" to get supplies in via this route, he said this decision has come ""far too late"".

Last year,the RAF dropped aid into Gaza, but humanitarian organisations warned it wasn't enough and was potentially dangerous. In March 2024, five people were killed when an aid parachute failed and supplies fell on them.

For now, Sir Keir has rejected calls to follow French PresidentEmmanuel Macronandrecognise a Palestinian state-despite more than 220 MPssigning a cross-party letter to demand he takes this step.

The prime minister is instead demanding a ceasefire and ""lasting peace"" - and says he will only consider an independent state as part of a negotiated peace deal."
Huge security operation as Donald Trump tees off at his Scottish golf course,https://news.sky.com/story/huge-security-operation-as-donald-trump-tees-off-at-his-scottish-golf-course-13402055,,Scotland correspondent,"Donald Trump has been spotted on his golf course in Scotland, with a massive security operation keeping both media and locals at a distance.

Roads were closed around the Turnberry course as a large number of police and army, and navy personnel were seen searching the grounds before theUS presidentteed off on Saturday, the first full day of his UK visit.

Sniffer dogs patrolled the course, snipers were deployed, a police helicopter hovered overhead and a boat sat off the coast.

His first round of golf came hours after an attack on Europe, in which the US president told Europe to""get your act together"" on immigration, which he said was ""killing"" the continent.

But he had words of praise forSir Keir Starmerafter touching down in Ayrshire on Friday, describing him as a ""good man"" while adding he is ""slightly more liberal than I am"".

Mr Trump is due to have talks with Sir Keir and Scottish First Minister John Swinney, as well as discussing trade with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The president headed straight to the resort, which he bought in 2014 and which he wants to see host The Open, after landing.

Scotland correspondent

We heard him before we saw him.

It was the surreal moment Donald Trump trundled over the Turnberry course with music blaring from his golf buggy.

The songs of choice were even more interesting given the crisis facing the US president amid the Jeffrey Epstein saga.

Bridge Over Troubled Water by Simon and Garfunkel was the hit swirling around as the wind projected the music beyond a wall of police that had formed to protect the president.

It was an eyebrow-raising moment to say the least.

Mr Trump waved at the Sky News camera as I shouted a question about Scottish hospitality. It was a different story when I pivoted the topic to Epstein. He hit a shot and sped off.

The 20-strong entourage of buggies followed him as he carried on his journey.

Some may wonder why all the fuss over a man playing golf? But this is the president, and the kitchen sink has been thrown at the policing operation.

Moments before we spotted Mr Trump, army and navy personnel were seen sweeping the grassy banks. Sniffer dogs patrolled the course while snipers watched over in a bid to fend off any intruders.

The circus involved the police helicopter hovering overhead and the marine unit bobbing about off the choppy Ayrshire coast.

Saturday is for play, and on Sunday it's politics. But, as ever, the Trump show is unpredictable.

Saturday will be the first real test of PoliceScotlandduring the visit as it looks to control the demonstrations in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, as well as any that spring up near the president's course.

The force has asked forsupport from others around the UKto bolster officer numbers, with both organisations representing senior officers and the rank-and-file claiming there is likely to be an impact on policing across the country for the duration of the visit.

Before the visit started, Mr Swinney appealed to Scots to protest ""peacefully and within the law"".

Hundreds of protesters had gathered in both cities by early afternoon, with demonstrators in the centre of Aberdeen seen waving banners with anti-Trump slogans, while one came dressed as the president with a large papier mache head.

Some members of the crowd also showed their support for Gaza, waving Palestinian flags.

On the golf course, the US president was followed by more than a dozen other buggies.

Mr Trump is expected to open a second course at another of his golf resorts in Balmedie in Aberdeenshire while he is in the country."
Unlicensed Botox-like injections spark outbreak of disease many doctors have never treated,https://news.sky.com/story/its-the-wild-west-dozens-of-women-develop-botulism-linked-to-anti-wrinkle-injections-13401548,,Katie Barnfield,"A woman who thought she was being injected with Botox was left unable to swallow and doctors thought she had suffered a stroke - after she contracted a life-threatening illness from a potentially illegal product.

Nicola Fairley is one of dozens of people who have developed botulism linked to unlicensed anti-wrinkle injections.

She had the procedure done with her regular beautician after winning a Facebook competition for three areas of ""Botox"".

""Within two or three hours my forehead and the sides of my eyes had started to freeze,"" Nicola says.

""At first I thought 'amazing', that's what I wanted - then it just carried on.""

Nicola was eventually sent to A&E in Durham, where she met several other patients who all had similar symptoms.

Doctors were stumped. ""They thought I'd had a stroke,"" she says.

Gregg Wallace speaks out after MasterChef sacking

""We all had problems with our eyes, some of us with our breathing. I couldn't swallow - they put me on nil by mouth because they were worried I would choke in the waiting room.""

It turns out all of the patients had recently had anti-wrinkle injections containing botulinum toxin.

Health officials believe they were imported, illegal products.

Botulism - the disease they caused - is so rare many doctors never see it in their entire careers.

It can cause symptoms including slurred speech and breathing problems, and can be deadly.

The disease is so unusual, and so many cases were coming in, that doctors exhausted their stocks of anti-toxin and had to ask hospitals as far away as London to get more.

The UK Health Security Agency has so far confirmed 38 cases of botulism linked to cosmetic toxin injections, but Sky News has been told of several more.

The outbreak began in the North East but cases have now been seen in the East of England and East Midlands as well.

There are only a handful of legal botulinum toxin products in the UK - of which Botox is one.

But cosmetic treatments are largely unregulated, with anyone allowed to inject products like fillers and toxins without any medical training.

Cheap, illegal products imported from overseas are easily available.

'It's the Wild West'

Dr Steven Land runs Novellus Aesthetics clinic in Newcastle upon Tyne. He worked for decades as an emergency medicine doctor before moving into aesthetics.

He says he has been warning health officials of an outbreak for years.

""It's the Wild West,"" Dr Land told Sky News.

""Because anyone can do this, there is a lack of knowledge around what is legal, what's not legal, what is okay to be injected.

""These illegal toxins could have 50 units, 5,000 units or rat poison - there could be anything in there.""

Dr Land showed us messages that he says he gets on a weekly basis, from sellers trying to push him cheap, unlicensed products.

They advertise ""limited time offers"" and cheap bundles on toxins imported from overseas. He calls them ""drug dealers"".

""They are preying on the lack of knowledge among non-medical practitioners,"" he says.

Age verification tools on adult websites bypassed in seconds,https://news.sky.com/story/hackers-prove-age-verification-systems-on-pornography-sites-can-be-bypassed-in-seconds-13401733,,"By Mickey Carroll, science and technology reporter and Francesca Casonato, video journalist","Ethical hackers have shown Sky News how new age verification systems can be bypassed on pornographic websites in a matter of seconds.

On Friday, toughened rules came into force that mean companies hosting adult content online must block under-18s using ""highly effective age verification"".

That could include AI tools that use pictures to estimate someone's age, bank or ID checks, or more technical solutions using browser cookies.

But hours later, two ethical hackers demonstrated just how simple it is to get around the measures designed to protect young people on the internet.

Using widely available technology, Chris Kubecka and Paula Popovici quickly accessed numerous pornography sites without ever verifying their ages.

Their devices were running standard software, and the tricks they used were simple.

This, Ms Kubecka said, showed the systems will not be effective at stopping under-18s from accessing explicit content online.

Although Sky News has verified the methods used by Ms Kubecka and Ms Popovici, we won't give details or name any software used.

Some of the explicit websites they checked had not turned on any age verification, despite declaring in June that they would.

In response to our findings, Ofcom said these checks ""will help stop young children from stumbling across porn"".

The regulator added: ""While the new rules have only been in place for a matter of hours, we will be actively assessing compliance to make sure platforms have age checks in place and that they are highly effective.

""Companies that fall short can expect to face enforcement action.""

A spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology told Sky News: ""We expect these laws to be robustly implemented by tech companies. If they fail to do so, the regulator is ready to take severe enforcement action, including tough fines.""

There is also a risk that age verification could push users towards more dangerous corners of the internet in search of pornography.

By 10am on Friday, data suggested an extra 66,000 internet users in the UK had begun using the dark web.

Ms Kubecka fears this number may only increase.

""That is one of the concerns that I have because I don't want illegal or extreme content being normalised in our teens,"" she said.

Plane plunges 300ft in 36 seconds to avoid another aircraft,https://news.sky.com/story/plane-plunges-300ft-in-36-seconds-to-avoid-other-aircraft-13401958,,Author not found,"A US passenger plane made a dramatic plunge minutes after take-off to dodge another aircraft - injuring two cabin crew and causing passengers to shoot out of their seats.

The Southwest flight had just taken off from Burbank in California when the pilot received an alert about a nearby plane.

Data from FlightAware shows the aircraft dropped by 91m (300ft) in just 36 seconds. Those on board said they felt panicked, and some feared the plane was about to crash.

Comedian Jimmy Dore posted on X: ""Pilot had to dive aggressively to avoid mid-air collision … myself and plenty of people flew out of their seats and bumped heads on ceiling, a flight attendant needed medical attention.""

Stef Zambrano saw a woman who wasn't wearing her seatbelt thrown out of her seat, who then said: ""I want to get off this plane. I want to be on the ground.""

Another passenger, Steve Ulasewicz, told NBC Los Angeles that it felt like the plane was in freefall for 10 seconds.

""People were screaming. You know, it was pandemonium. People thought the plane was going down,"" he added.

On Saturday, Cambodian authorities reported 12 new deaths, bringing its toll to 13, while Thai officials said a soldier was killed, raising the number of deaths to 20 - mostly civilians.

New flashpoints emerged on Saturday more than 100 km (60 miles) from other conflict points along the long-contested border.

There were clashes in the early morning in the neighbouring Thai coastal province of Trat and Cambodia's Pursat Province, both sides said.

International pressure is mounting on both sides to declare a ceasefire.

At an emergency meeting in New York late on Friday, the UN Security Council unanimously called on both sides to show restraint and resolve the dispute peacefully, a council diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said.

Malaysia, which chairs the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes both parties, called for an end to hostilities and offered to mediate.

Cambodia's defence ministry said Thailand had launched ""a deliberate, unprovoked, and unlawful military attack"" but Thailand's acting prime minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, said Bangkok had exercised the ""utmost restraint and patience in the face of [Phnom Penh's] provocations and aggression"".

Cambodia's Information Minister Neth Pheaktra said on Saturday the clashes had forced 10,865 Cambodian families - 37,635 people - in three border provinces to evacuate, while Thai officials said more than 131,000 people had fled their border villages.

Villages around Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey province were largely deserted, as people loaded their belongings on homemade tractors or sheltered in makeshift underground bunkers, covering them with wood, tarpaulin and zinc sheets to shield themselves from shelling.

Several hundred residents went to a remote Buddhist temple where plastic tents were set up under the trees.

Ten Greenpeace activists arrested after suspending themselves from bridge outside Edinburgh,https://news.sky.com/story/ten-greenpeace-activists-arrested-after-suspending-themselves-from-bridge-outside-edinburgh-13402046,,Author not found,"Ten Greenpeace activists have been arrested after suspending themselves from a bridge over a river to halt a tanker carrying fracked gas.

The Forth Road Bridge outside Edinburgh was closed on Friday due to the demonstration, with Police Scotland alerted shortly after 1pm.

The protesters ended up dangling around 25m above the water level at high tide.

Greenpeace announced it had ended the demonstration on Saturday morning, saying it had ""achieved what we set out to do"".

The group said its activists had prevented the Ineos tanker from delivering the gas for a full 24 hours, because the vessel could only travel to the Ineos petrochemical plant at nearby Grangemouth during high tides.

Its specially trained activists began climbing down their ropes on Saturday morning.

Greenpeace said all 10 descended safely and were voluntarily transported to Port Edgar in South Queensferry, where it said they were arrested by officers from Police Scotland on suspicion of culpable and reckless conduct.

Police Scotland confirmed five men aged between 35 and 40, as well as five women aged between 25 and 42, had been arrested.

It said further inquiries were ongoing and the Forth Road Bridge remained closed to traffic as of Saturday morning.

Amy Cameron, programme director at Greenpeace UK, said: ""By blocking Ineos, we've drawn global attention to the company's bottomless appetite for plastic production, false solutions and profit for its billionaire boss Jim Ratcliffe.""

Describing the ""plastic pollution problem"" as ""massive"", she added: ""Less than 10% of plastic is currently recycled globally, and this is set to rise to just 17% by 2060, while the amount of plastic we're producing is set to triple.

""The only solution is to address the problem at source which means securing a strong global plastics treaty that imposes legally-binding caps on plastic production.""

What does recognising a Palestinian state mean - and will other countries follow in France's footsteps?,https://news.sky.com/story/what-does-recognising-a-palestinian-state-mean-and-will-other-countries-follow-in-frances-footsteps-13401523,,Author not found,"France is set to become the first G7 country to recognise Palestine as a state.

Emmanuel Macronannounced the major change of policyin a letter to the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, on Thursday evening, with the French leader expected to make a formal announcement at the United Nations General Assembly in September.

MrMacronsaid he hopes the plan will bring peace to the region, but it drew angry rebukes from Israel and the United States.

There is also no guarantee other countries in the G7 - seven of the world's largest advanced economies - will follow suit.

Here is what you need to know about the significance of recognising a Palestinian state, the timing of the decision, and whether other countries are likely to follow France.

What does recognising a Palestinian state mean?

The decision to recognise Palestine as a state is mostly symbolic, but comes amid growing international pressure to end whatthe UNhas described as a ""humanitarian crisis"" inGaza.

Out of the 193 UN member states, 144 already recognise Palestine as a state.

That includes Russia, China and India, as well as more than a dozen in Europe, includingSpain, Ireland and Norway. But until Thursday, no G7 country had committed to it.

Why did France make the decision now?

Mr Macron has been leaning towards recognising a Palestinian state for months as part of a bid to keep the idea of a two-state solution alive, despite pressure from other countries not to do so.

His announcement came days before France and Saudi Arabia co-host a conference at the UN, where 40 foreign ministers will discuss a two-state solution.

France and the UN now have a framework to work with other countries that are considering recognising a Palestinian state or have misgivings about doing so.

What is a two-state solution?

A two-state solution would see an independent Palestinian state established alongside the existing state of Israel - giving both peoples their own territory.

The Palestinians seek an independent state in the occupied West Bank, annexed east Jerusalem and Gaza, territories that have been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and most of Israel's political class have long been opposed to Palestinian statehood, and argue that it would reward militants after the 7 October attacks launched by Hamas in 2023.

One of the biggest obstacles to a two-state solution would be deciding what the borders of a potential Palestinian state would be.

Many believe they should be the same ones that existed before 1967, but since then, increasing numbers of Israeli settlements have been established inside the West Bank, with around 600,000 Israelis now living there and in Occupied East Jerusalem.

How have Israel and Palestine responded to France?

Israel's Mr Netanyahu strongly condemned the decision, saying recognising a Palestinian state now would be a ""launch pad to annihilate Israel - not to live in peace beside it"".

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said America also ""strongly rejects"" Mr Macron's plan, calling it a ""slap in the faceto the victims of October 7th"".

Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Jerusalem expressed ""thanks and appreciation"" to the French leader.

What has the UK said?

Sir Keir Starmer has already resisted calls within the Labour Party to recognise a Palestinian state, as he believes this should happen after a ceasefire is agreed, as part of the peace process in Gaza.

More than221 UK MPs have now signed a cross-party letterdemandingSir Keirfollow France's lead.

On Thursday night, he insisted he is ""clear that statehood is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people"", adding that a ceasefire would put the region on the right path towards the recognition of a Palestinian state and a two-state solution.

Speaking to Sky News Breakfast on Friday, Technology Secretary Peter Kyle reiterated that the government wants Palestinian statehood, but said the most pressing issue in Gaza is ""a matter of people starving"" rather than a diplomatic one.

Sir Keir will attend an emergency call with Germany and France later on Friday to discuss what he described as a ""human catastrophe"" that has ""reached new depths"".

What about other countries?

In response to France's decision, theGermangovernment said Berlin still backs a two-state solution but won't recognise a Palestinian state for now, instead stressing the need for a Gaza ceasefire, hostage release, and urgent humanitarian aid.

Canadaalso pressed Israel to seek peace, with Prime Minister Mark Carney reiterating support for a two-state solution, but has so far stopped short of recognising Palestine as a state.

Australia's prime minister, Anthony Albanese, described the situation in Gaza as a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" and said his country is ""committed to a future where both Israeli and Palestinian people can live in peace and safety within secure and internationally recognised borders"".

Italy's foreign minister said the recognition of a Palestinian state must also recognise Israel as a state.

""A Palestinian state that does not recognise Israel means that the problem will not be resolved,"" Antonio Tajani told a meeting of his conservative Forza Italia party in Rome.

Spain, which already recognises Palestinian statehood, welcomed Mr Macron's announcement. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote in a statement on X: ""Together, we must protect what Netanyahu is trying to destroy. The two-state solution is the only solution.""

Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry also said it ""commends this historic decision"" and called on other countries to take ""similar positive steps""."
British surgeon claims IDF shooting Gazans in specific areas - 'almost like a game of target practice',https://news.sky.com/story/almost-like-a-game-of-target-practice-british-surgeon-says-idf-shooting-gazans-at-aid-points-13401434,,Author not found,"A British surgeon who recently returned from Gaza has told Sky News that there is ""profound malnutrition"" among the population - and claims IDF soldiers are shooting civilians at aid points ""almost like a game of target practice"".

Dr Nick Maynard spent four weeks working inside Nasser Hospital, where a lack of food has left medics struggling to treat children and toddlers.

The conditions inside the hospital, in the south of the Strip, have been documented in a Sky News report.

""There were four premature babies who died during the first two weeks when I was in Nasser Hospital - and there will be many, many more deaths unless the Israelis allow proper food to get in there.""

'They were shells'

Dr Nick Maynard has been going toGazafor the past 15 years - and this is his third visit to the territory since the war began.

The British surgeon added that virtually all of the kids in the paediatric unit of Nasser Hospital are being fed with sugar water.

""They've got a small amount of formula feed for very small babies, but not enough,"" he warned.

Dr Maynard said the lack of aid has also had a huge impact on his colleagues.

""I saw people I'd known for years and I didn't recognise some of them,"" he added. ""Two colleagues had lost 20kg and 30kg respectively. They were shells, they're all hungry.

""They're going to work every day, then going home to their tents where they have no food.""

IDF 'shooting Gazans at aid points'

Elsewhere in the interview, Dr Maynard claimed Israeli soldiers are shooting civilians at aid points ""almost like a game of target practice"".

The IDF said it ""categorically rejected"" claims of ""intentional harm to civilians, particularly in the manner described"".

Dr Maynard claimed he has operated on boys as young as 11 who had been ""shot at food distribution points"" run by the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.

""They had gone to get food for their starving families and they were shot,"" he said.

""I operated on one 12-year-old boy who died on the operating table because his injuries were so severe.""

Dr Maynard continued: ""What was even more distressing was the pattern of injuries that we saw, the clustering of injuries to particular body parts on certain days.

""One day they'd be coming in predominately with gunshot wounds to the head or the neck, another day to the chest, another day to the abdomen.

""Twelve days ago, four young teenage boys came in, all of whom had been shot in the testicles and deliberately so. This is not coincidental.

""The clustering was far too obvious to be coincidental, and it seemed to us like this was almost like a game of target practice.

""I would never have believed this possible unless I'd witnessed this with my own eyes.""

The Israel Defense Forces told Sky News: ""The IDF categorically rejects the claims of intentional harm to civilians, particularly in the manner described. For the sake of clarity, the army's binding orders prohibit forces operating in the area from intentionally firing at civilians.

""We are aware of reports of casualties among those who arrived at the aid distribution sites. These incidents are under examination by the relevant IDF authorities. Any allegation of a violation of the law or regulations will be thoroughly investigated, including taking appropriate action if necessary.

""The IDF is working to facilitate and ease the distribution of humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) at the designated distribution centres, as well as through other international actors. These efforts are being conducted under difficult and complex operational conditions. As part of its operational conduct, the IDF draws lessons and conducts systematic learning processes in order to improve its operational response.""

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has been managing the supply of aid to Gaza since Israel lifted an 11-week blockade in May.

It has four aid distribution sites, all of which are located in Israeli military zones, with journalists prohibited from entering.

More than 1,000 peoplehave been reported killedwhiletrying to receive food aidsince the GHF took over, according to the UN.

UNRWA, its relief agency for Gaza, has heavily criticised the scheme.

Commissioner general Philippe Lazzarini said: ""The so-called 'GHF' distribution scheme is a sadistic death trap. Snipers open fire randomly on crowds as if they are given a licence to kill.""

Listen to The World with Richard Engel and Yalda Hakim every Wednesday

Just a fraction of the aid trucks needed are making it into the enclave, the UN has said, while multiple aid groups and the World Health Organisation have warned Gazans arefacing ""mass starvation"".

Mr Lazzarini quoted a colleagueon Thursday and said malnourished Palestinians in Gaza ""are neither dead nor alive, they are walking corpses""."

The letter is being organised by theLabourbackbencher Sarah Champion, who also sits as the International Development Committee chair.

They write: ""British recognition of Palestine would be particularly powerful given its role as the author of the Balfour Declaration and the former Mandatory Power in Palestine.

""Since 1980 we have backed a two-state solution. Such a recognition would give that position substance as well as living up to a historic responsibility we have to the people under that Mandate.""

As Number 10 came under growing pressure, Sir Keir on Friday released a statement onGazacalling the ""appalling scenes"" in the Strip ""unrelenting"".

Israel has denied there is a food shortage in Gaza - despite earlier this week more than 100 aid agencies warning of mass starvation in Gaza - and claims it had to take control of the supply and distribution of aid because Hamas fighters have been stealing aid before it reached civilians. Hamas has denied this, as have some humanitarian groups, including USAID.

Talking about the need for a regional ""lasting peace"", the prime minister said: ""Recognition of a Palestinian state has to be one of those steps. I am unequivocal about that. But it must be part of a wider plan which ultimately results in a two-state solution and lasting security for Palestinians and Israelis.""

US President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters at the White House before heading to Scotland, was dismissive of Mr Macron's statement. ""What he says doesn't matter,"" he said. ""He's a very good guy. I like him, but that statement doesn't carry weight.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""We strongly condemn President Macron's decision to recognise a Palestinian state next to Tel Aviv in the wake of the October 7 massacre. Such a move rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became.

""A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel - not to live in peace beside it.

Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, on Friday morning defended the government's resistance to calls for immediate UK recognition of a Palestinian state.

""We want Palestinian statehood. We desire it, and we want to make sure the circumstances can exist where that kind of long-term political solution can have the space to evolve and make sure that it can become a permanent circumstance that can bring peace to the entire region,"" he told Sky News.

""But right now, today, we've got to focus on what will ease the suffering, and it is extreme, unwarranted suffering in Gaza that has to be the priority for us today.""

An emergency call with Germany and France was scheduled for Friday to discuss what Sir Keir described as a ""human catastrophe"" which has ""reached new depths"".

The Foreign Office has maintained it is committed to recognising a Palestinian state but has expressed a willingness to do so only when it will have the ""most impact in support of a peace process"".

It said: ""We continue to provide lifesaving aid to support Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, and to work closely in support of the Palestinian Authority."""

Humanitarian aid organisation World Central Kitchenpaused its operationin Gaza in November after a number of its workers were killed in an Israeli airstrike last year.

Aid workers in Gaza - who help provide food, medicine and shelter for the millions displaced there - have been affected by the ongoing conflict between Israel andHamas.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation - anIsraeland US-backed organisation - has been distributing food packages in Gaza since the end of May, after Israel eased its 11-week blockade of aid into the territory.

More than 1,000 peoplehave reportedly been killedwhiletrying to receive food aidsince then, according to the UN, with the territory facing a starvation crisis.

Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Friday that nine people have died of malnutrition in the past 24 hours.

In a post on Facebook, the ministry said a total of 122 people, including 83 children, have died because of a lack of food since the war began.

In the first two weeks of July, the UN children's agency UNICEF treated 5,000 children facing acute malnutrition in the Strip.

On Friday, the UN warned that Gaza was running out of specialised therapeutic foods to treat malnourished children.

Aid was air-dropped into the territory from military planes last year by countries, including Jordan, the US and the UK via the Royal Air Force, but humanitarian organisations warned it wasn't enough.

It is also a potentially dangerous way to deliver supplies, and in March 2024, five people were killed when an aid parachute failed and a parcel fell on them.

Communities correspondent

Israel says there is no famine in Gaza – so why is it sanctioning an urgent international aid drop by air, particularly when doing so safely also means having a temporary pause in its bombardment of Gaza.

The reality is – whatever the public message – Israel must be feeling the intense pressure from the international community and global aid organisations to ease its blockade.

The UN secretary-general has said starvation is knocking on every door in Gaza.  The F word – famine – is even being talked about on Israeli television channels.

We understand the Jordanian government is discussing playing a role in the aid drop and we already know that the UN says there is enough food stockpiled in Egypt and Jordan to feed Gazans for three months.

Yet it hasn't reached hungry mouths in Gaza because Israel stands accused of making it simply too difficult to transport aid by road around a dangerous conflict zone for organisations, including the UN, which are trying to step in in the face of claims that the main sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation have turned into ""death traps"".

Dropping large aid packages may be the quickest way to get food into Gaza, given the circumstances, but it is also very dangerous, because of the scramble that ensues amongst people trying to reach the supplies.

However, this sign of movement in the aid crisis comes after a desperate week for Gazans fighting to survive hunger in a war zone.

Israel will remind the world it stopped the old ways of aid distribution because it says aid was falling into the hands of the militant group Hamas, still holding 20 living Israeli hostages.

There have also been reports of people drowning while trying to reach supplies that had fallen into the sea.

Israel has been at war with Hamas in Gaza since the Palestinian militant grouprampaged through southern Israel, killing 1,200 people,and taking around 250 hostage,on 7 October 2023.

Israel has denied there is a food shortage in Gaza - despite earlier this week more than 100 aid agencies warning of mass starvation in Gaza - and claims it had to take control of the supply and distribution of aid because Hamas fighters have been stealing aid before it reached civilians. Hamas has denied this, as have some humanitarian groups, including USAID.

Responding to reports the IDF had previously fired at civilians while they tried to access aid in Gaza, the IDF said it ""categorically rejects the claims of intentional harm to civilians"". It added: ""For the sake of clarity, the army's binding orders prohibit forces operating in the area from intentionally firing at civilians.""

Oasis photographers remember the early days: 'The journalist had to take a week off afterwards!',https://news.sky.com/story/oasis-photographers-remember-the-early-days-the-journalist-had-to-take-a-week-off-afterwards-13400664,,,"It was a cold, typically rainy Manchester evening, October 1993, when Michael Spencer Jones set out to meet a new guitar band he had been commissioned to photograph.

The weather was miserable, he didn't know their music, wasn't totally in the mood. ""I had to drag myself from home, thinking: is it going to be worth the trouble?""

On the drive to the Out Of The Blue studio in Ancoats, on the outskirts of the city centre, a song he'd never heard before came on the local radio station. ""It was like, wow, what is that?"" The track was Columbia, byOasis, the band he was on his way to meet.

He started to get excited.

Spencer Jones had previously metNoel Gallagherduring the musician's time as a roadie for fellow Manchester band Inspiral Carpets. But notLiam.

""As a photographer, obviously, the aesthetic of a band is massively important,"" he says as he recalls that first shoot. ""I'm just looking down the camera lens with a certain amount of disbelief.""

In front of him was a 21-year-old, months before the start of the fame rollercoaster that lay ahead. And yet. ""I was looking at a face that just seemed to embody the quality of stardom.""

'Success was inevitable'

It was the start of a partnership that continued throughout the band's heyday, with Spencer Jones shooting the covers for their first three albums, their most successful records, and the singles that went with them.

""You work with bands pre-fame and there's always that question: are they going to make it? With Oasis there was never that question. Their success was inevitable.""

There was a confidence, even in those early days. ""Incredible, intoxicating confidence. [They were] not interested in any kind of social norms or social constraints.""

It wasn't arrogance, he says, of a criticism sometimes levelled at the Gallaghers. ""They just had this enormous self-belief.""

Spencer Jones was one of several photographers who followed the band, capturing the moments that became part of rock history.

'Noel had an uncanny intuition'

Jill Furmanovsky, who started working with Oasis towards the end of 1994, a few months after the release of debut album Definitely Maybe, says Noel always seemed aware their time together should be documented.

""An uncanny intuition, really, that it was important,"" she says. ""I think Noel has been aware right from the start, because for him that's what he used to look at when he used to buy his Smiths records or Leo Sayer or whatever, he would stare at the covers and be fascinated by the pictures.""

Contrary to popular belief, Furmanovsky says the brothers got on fairly well most of the time, ""otherwise they wouldn't have been able to function"".

She picks one shoot in 1997, around the release of their third album, Be Here Now, as one of the more memorable ones. Noel had shared his thoughts about the band on a chalkboard and ""they were having such a laugh.""

But when things did erupt, it became significant. ""There were tensions in some shoots but they never started hitting each other in front of me or anything like that. I used to complain about it, actually - 'don't leave me out of those pictures where you're really arguing!'.""

In Paris in 1995, tensions had boiled over. ""It's one of my favourites,"" she says of the shoot. ""It reflects not just the band but the family situation, these brothers in a strop with each other.""

What is notable, she says, is that they were happy for photographers to take candid shots, not just set up pictures to show them ""looking cool"". Pictures that on the surface might sound mundane, showing ""what they were really like - tensions, mucking about, sometimes yawning... This was the genius of Noel and [former Oasis press officer] Johnny Hopkins.""

Furmanovsky also notes the women who worked behind the scenes for Oasis - unusual at a time when the industry was even more male-dominated than it is now - and how they kept them in line.

""They got on well working with women,"" she says. ""Maggie Mouzakitis was their tour manager for ages and was so young, but she ruled. For a band one could say were a bunch of macho Manchester blokes, they had a lot of women working in senior positions.""

This is down to the influence of their mum, Peggy, she adds. ""Absolutely crucial.""

Furmanovsky has been working with Noel on an upcoming book documenting her time with the band, and says she initially wanted to start with a picture of the Gallagher matriarch. ""Noel said to me, 'Jill, you do know she wasn't actually in the band?'""

Touring with Oasis - 'the journalist had to take a week off'

Kevin Cummins was commissioned to take pictures when Oasis signed to Creation Records, and it ""kind of spiralled out of control a little bit"", he laughs.

""I photographed them for NME, gave them their first cover. I photographed them in Man City shirts because we were all Man City fans, and City were at the time sponsored by a Japanese electronics company, Brother. It seemed a perfect fit.""

The early days documenting the band were ""fairly riotous"", he says. ""They were quite young, they were obviously enjoying being in the limelight.

""I remember we went on tour with them for three days for an NME 'on the road' piece, and the journalist who came with me had to take a week off afterwards.

""I dipped in and out of tours occasionally - I've always done that with musicians because I cannot imagine spending more than about seven or eight days on tour with somebody, it would drive you nuts. They're so hedonistic, especially in the early days. It's very, very difficult to keep up.""

Cummins says the relationship between Noel and Liam was ""like anybody's relationship, if you've got a younger brother - he'd get on your nerves.""

During the shoot for the City shirt pictures, he says, ""Liam kicked a ball at Noel, Noel pushed him, Liam pushed him back. They have a bit of a pushing match and then they stop and they get on with it.""

Another time, following a show in Portsmouth, ""as soon as we got [to the hotel] after the gig, Liam threw all the plastic furniture in the pool. Noel looked at him and said, 'where are we going to sit?' And he made him get in the pool and get all the furniture out. So there were like attempts at being rock and roll, and not quite getting it right sometimes.""

Cummins says he has ""very affectionate"" memories of working with Oasis. ""I've got a lot of very sensitive looking pictures of Liam and people are really surprised when they see them,"" he says. ""But he is a very sensitive lad... it's just he was irritating because he was younger and he wanted to make himself heard.""

Getting ready for the reunion

All three photographers have yet to see the reunion show, but all have tickets. All say the announcement last summer came as a surprise.

""There was an inkling of it, I suppose, just in the thawing of the comments between the brothers, but I still wouldn't have guessed it,"" says Furmanovsky, who has a book out later this year, and whose pictures feature in the programme. ""It's wonderful they have pulled it off with such conviction and passion.""

Cummins' work can be seen in a free outdoor exhibition at Wembley Park, which fans will be able to see throughout the summer until the final gigs there in September.

""I think the atmosphere at the gigs seems to have been really friendly... I like the idea that people are taking their kids and they're passing the baton on a little bit,"" he says. ""Everyone's just having a blast and it's like the event of the summer - definitely something we need at the moment.""

Spencer Jones, who released his second Oasis book, Definitely Maybe - A View From Within, for the album's 30th anniversary last year - adds: ""They really seem to be capturing a new generation of fans and I don't think a band has ever done that [to this extent] before. Bands from 20, 30 years ago normally just take their traditional fanbase with them.""

But he says his first thought when the reunion was announced was for the Gallaghers' mum, Peggy. ""I think for any parent, to have two children who don't talk is pretty tough,"" he says. ""It's that notion of reconciliation - if they can do it, anyone can do it.

""The fact they're walking on stage, hands clasped together, there's a huge amount of symbolism there that transcends Oasis and music. Especially in a fractured society, that unity is inspiring. Everyone's had a bit of a rough time since COVID, battle weary with life itself. I think people generally are just gagging to have some fun.""

Brothers: Liam And Noel Through The Lens Of Kevin Cummins is on at Wembley Park until 30 September. Definitely Maybe - A View From Within, by Michael Spencer Jones, available through Spellbound Galleries, is out now. Oasis: Trying To Find A Way Out Of Nowhere, by Jill Furmanovsky and edited by Noel Gallagher, published by Thames & Hudson, is out from 23 September."
"Sheer joy as kids see the sea for the first time, as cost of living's impact on school trips revealed",https://news.sky.com/story/rising-costs-and-tight-budgets-mean-school-trips-are-under-threat-even-though-some-kids-have-never-seen-the-sea-13401639,,Anjum Peerbacos,"It was an escape from the everyday and a glimpse of a world beyond the classroom.

Children from Rockliffe Manor Primary School in Plumstead, south London, headed for a day of seaside fun at Broadstairs Beach in Kent.

Some of them had never been to a beach before, and some had never even seen the sea.

I was invited to join the teachers and pupils on the trip.

Teachers were armed with first aid kits and the necessary supplies, including lunches and suncream.

Children in Year 1 arrived in their swimming costumes, with Spiderman and Minecraft ones being particularly popular.

The swimming costumes proved to be rather problematic when the children were told they needed to visit the toilets before embarking on the coach.

Cost of living

They came armed with their buckets, spades and lilos.

The children were beside themselves with excitement, and it took an army of adults to get them there.

One parent said her son had been up since 5am because he was so excited about going to the seaside.

That sense of wonder is why 83% of parents say school trips help shape their child's future.

But with rising costs and shrinking school budgets, more of these opportunities are falling away.

A recent report said 94% of parents have been forced to cut back on spending due to the cost of living crisis.

As the tide rolled in and buckets filled with wet sand, the beach buzzed with energy. Children chased each other through shallow pools, buried their teachers up to their knees, and shrieked with delight every time a wave got too close.

Andrea Braithwaite, a parent on the trip, said: ""Sometimes parents don't necessarily have the means to get to places like this. We live in London, so it takes organisation, maybe they haven't got the time off work.""

There was giggling on the coach, and the sheer joy could be felt everywhere. There were storybooks for the long journey.

But once we got to the beach, the carefully orchestrated schedule that I was sent went out the window.

The children were in their element.

Miss Roper, one of the teachers, asked the children if they were ready to go into the water.

""Yes!"" they all screamed.

They all ran in - and some stayed in the water until much later in the afternoon.

They just couldn't get enough.

Ms Braithwaite said: ""It's difficult to even have a swimming costume. You might not be able to have those things for their children so it's really good that the school arranged this day for them.""

The children were ecstatic, and according to the research, a staggering 97% say they get excited about school trips.

Headteacher Nancy Cook said: ""When we think about shared discussion and learning in the classroom, the children don't have reference points to pinpoint they're learning, too.

""It's really hard and becomes too abstract for them. So giving children opportunities, not only are they hugely exciting, but also become developmental points that they can build on in the future.""

There were sandcastles being built and ice creams being eaten.

And as we were getting ready for the trip back to London, one child had carefully scooped sand into an empty bottle. When asked why, he looked up at me and said softly: ""So I can remember this day forever.""

As the sun dipped behind the grey horizon and the children climbed back onto the coach, sand still clinging to their socks, one boy turned around and said: ""This was the best day ever.""

What is Tea - the women-only app with millions of users?,https://news.sky.com/story/what-is-tea-the-women-only-app-with-millions-of-users-13401888,,"By Dylan Donnelly, news reporter","Millions of women in the US have downloaded a ""dating advice"" app that claims it catches catfish, checks for hidden marriages and keeps users safe from men online.

According to App Store tracker SensorTower.com, Tea Dating Advice has become the most popular free app in the US, and is the number one lifestyle download.

It also claimed earlier this week to have recently gained close to a million new users, and said on Instagram it has more than four million women ""in our community"".

However, the women-only app has come under fire for being ""anti-men"", and for a data breach that saw 13,000 user photos leaked.

But what is Tea? And why has it proved controversial?

What is the app?

Tea Dating Advice is a women-only app that allows users to anonymously post about men they are dating in the US.

The app's website says it was launched ""to give women the tools they need to date safely"" - and offers AI-powered reverse image searching to catch catfish using fake images on dating profiles.

It also offers phone number searching to check if men have ""hidden marriages"", background checks to look for criminal records, and a map of registered sex offenders.

While these features aren't unique to Tea - with most being publicly accessible - the app offers them in one package.

Tea also touts that it has ""the largest women's group chat in the US, where users share experiences, anonymous dating reviews, and support"".

Sean Cook, a Bay Area tech executive, founded and self-funded the app in 2023 because his mother was catfished and talked to men with criminal records while dating online.

Who can use it?

Only women can use the app, which requires users to register by creating a username including location, birth date, a photo and official identification.

Tea says it deletes all photos after a review, where moderators approve or deny applications and verify if new users are women.

All users who get accepted are promised anonymity outside of the usernames they choose, and taking screenshots of what's in the app is also blocked.

Once approved, users can leave comments describing specific men as a ""red flag"" or ""green flag"", and share other information about them.

Comments on Tea's Instagram show that applications aren't that straightforward however, with a number of people saying it takes days to be approved.

While men cannot use the app, Tea says any takedown requests should be emailed to their support desk with their name, location, as much information as possible about the content in question, as well as a photo.

What are the concerns?

Tea has faced a heavy backlash, with The Times calling it a ""man-shaming"" app, and a post in the MensRights subreddit saying it ""must be deleted"".

Much like the Facebook pages it resembles, the app has also been criticised for devolving into places for gossip or for spreading possible misinformation about people.

Sky's US partner network NBC News reported that judges in Illinois and California dismissed two defamation lawsuits filed by men who were posted in such Facebook groups.

Writing for the culture websiteDazed, Serena Smith said it's ""clear how an app like Tea could be abused"", noting doxxing - where private information about someone is shared online with malicious intent - and concerns about men ""who aren't abusers"" having their information published.

Speaking toFox 2, lawyer William Barnwell said men could have civil legal recourse if the posts affect their work, family life, or reputation as defamation might apply.

A male-only version of the app - Cheeky - has also been launched, offering anonymous chats about dating. It says on it's official Instagram that it's ""our response to the Tea App"".

However, NBC News reported the creator of Teaborn - a previous men-only alternative that climbed to number three in the free apps chart - had condemned its users for allegedly sharing revenge porn on that app.

What happened with the Tea data breach?

NBC News reported that thousands of accounts were leaked after a hacker managed to breach the company's database.

Tea has confirmed the leak to Sky News, and said it had identified ""unauthorised access to one of their systems and immediately launched a full investigation to assess the scope and impact"".

In preliminary findings, the company said the incident involved a legacy data storage system containing information from prior to February 2024.

Follow our channel and never miss an update

It is estimated that around 72,000 images - including approximately 13,000 images of selfies or selfies featuring a photo identification submitted during account verification and 59,000 images publicly viewable in the app from posts, comments and direct messages - were accessed.

""Protecting Tea users' privacy and data is their highest priority,"" it said. ""Tea is taking every necessary step to ensure the security of the platform and prevent further exposure.""

Posts on social media suggest the leak was first posted on 4chan and has been shared widely since then. Sky News has not independently verified any leaked information."
"Jay Slater suffered 'accidental death', inquest finds - all we learnt from hearing",https://news.sky.com/story/jay-slater-all-we-learnt-from-inquest-into-teenagers-death-in-tenerife-13400532,,Author not found,"The death of teenager Jay Slater has been ruled as ""accidental"" after an inquest.

The 19-year-old, from Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, disappeared on 17 June 2024 on the Spanish island of Tenerife after attending the NRG music festival.

He was reported missing and, after an extensive search and rescue mission and significant media attention, his body was found a month later on 15 July.

Jay Slater's inquest as it happened

An inquest into the teenager's death took place on 24 and 25 July at Preston Coroner's Court, after first being adjournedin May.

Dr James Adeley, a senior coroner for Lancashire and Blackburn with Darwen, concluded that Mr Slater died ""an accidental death"". He said he fell while trying to descend a ravine, which resulted in fatal skull trauma.

Here is everything we learned from the inquests in May and July which heard from experts, friends who were on holiday with Mr Slater and a testimony from his mother Debbie Duncan.

Why happened during the inquest in May?

The first inquest heard from Home Office pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd, who said Mr Slater’s injuries were ""entirely consistent"" with a fall from a great height and gave an official cause of death as a head injury.

He said there was no suggestion that the teenager had been assaulted or restrained.

Toxicology expert Dr Stephanie Martin said traces of MDMA and MDA, commonly known as ecstasy, along with cocaine and alcohol, were also found in Mr Slater's body.

Dr James Adeley decided to adjourn the inquest to July after a number of witnesses who had been asked to give evidence could not be traced or were unable to attend.

Mr Slater's mother Ms Duncan told the court in May that she wanted ""these people to be sat in front of us, because our son went on holiday and didn't come back, so there's questions we need to ask"".

Slater took a mixture of drugs and alcohol

Bradley Geoghegan and Lucy Law, who were with Mr Slater on holiday, gave evidence to the court when it resumed in July.

Mr Geoghegan told the court the trio landed in Tenerife on 13 June last year and met up with their friend, Brandon Hodgson.

While they were out that night, the group met Ayoub Qassim and Stephen Roccus, who were staying at the Airbnb Mr Slater travelled to in the village of Masca, before his disappearance.

On the night of 16 June, the day before Mr Slater disappeared, Mr Geoghegan said he had taken ecstasy pills and possibly ketamine, along with cocaine and alcohol.

Mr Slater 'on the buzz' and 'happy' before disappearance

Appearing at the inquest via video link, Mr Qassim, who Mr Slater stayed with before he disappeared, described the teenager as ""on the buzz"" in the early hours of 17 June, the day he went missing.

At roughly 5am, after a night of partying, Mr Qassim was with Mr Slater and other friends going between a club and a food spot.

""Jay was on the buzz, head bopping, chill, happy, mingling innit,"" he told the coroner.

Asked if he would have trusted Mr Slater to drive a car in his state then, Mr Qassim said ""nah"".

Mr Qassim said Mr Slater had asked to come back to the Masca Airbnb where he and his friend Mr Roccas were staying as everyone else had left.

He told the inquest he went to bed when they returned and could hear Mr Slater downstairs.

He was woken about an hour later because he needed to move his car and when he returned to the house Mr Slater was leaving and said he was going to catch a bus.

Me Qassim said: ""I went 'bro, there ain’t no buses coming here any time soon'.""

He said Mr Slater left, despite him explaining that buses did not pass regularly.

""At that point I presumed he'd sit at that bus stop and that's it. He's waiting till the first bus comes and he's out of there.""

'I told him to chill… now he's gone missing'

When questioned by family barrister Lois Norris, if he can remember any calls he received on the day Mr Slater disappeared, Mr Qassaim said he only vividly remembers being told he had gone missing.

Pointing out he'd only slept for one hour - and that he had suggested to Mr Slater that he should stay at their place, rather than take a bus - Mr Qassim said: ""I'm sort of annoyed, thinking 'f****** hell I need some sleep.

""I said: 'Bro, I told him to chill, and now you're telling me he's gone missing'.""

Slater called friends before his phone died

Having left the Airbnb, it is believed Mr Slater attempted to make the 14-hour walk back to the main Veronicas Strip. During this walk, coroner Dr Adeley said the teenager called Brandon Hodgson ""laughing and joking"".

Moments later, he called Mr Geoghegan on Snapchat, during which he told Mr Slater to get a taxi.

Mr Geoghegan said: ""I said put your maps on to see how far you were. It was like a 14-hour walk or an hour drive. I said, 'Get a taxi back', then he just goes, 'I will ring you back'.""

Mr Slater then called Ms Law saying he didn't know where he was with mountains ""all around"".

He said he needed a drink and was ""frightened"" but said he could not go back to the Airbnb, without expanding on why.

Ms Law told the court: ""By this stage, I'm panicking.""

Lack of sleep, training, water and poor judgement

Excerpts of information from the Spanish authorities were read out in court by Dr Adeley, including from the local Mountain Rescue services.

It said on the 29th day of the search for Mr Slater, they took to the treacherous Juan Lopez Ravine, where his body was later found.

Dr Adeley explained that the teenager's body was found eight metres above a dry stream bed, with mountain rescue crews estimating he fell between 20 and 25 metres.

""It was acknowledged the area was mountainous with inaccessible areas,"" Dr Adeley said in court.

The coroner says that there was ""very rough terrain"" at the point where the fall occurred.

He adds that factors contributing to Slater's fall were a lack of training, poor judgement, a lack of sleep and a lack of water.

'Our lives will never be the same'

Speaking at the inquest, Mr Slater's mother, Debbie Duncan, said the lives of their family will ""never be the same without Jay in it"".

""Not in a million years could we predict what was going to unfold,"" she said.

""There is no way that man is a ­racist. No way. And my sympathies go out to John because I don't want anybody to go through what I've been through.""

At one point, Wallace became tearful during the interview when describing the impact of the investigation on his family.

""I have seen myself written about in the same sentence asJimmy SavileandHuw Edwards, paedophiles and sex offenders. That is just so, so horrific.""

In respect to the specific allegation of unwanted touching, Wallace denied groping a woman and said that, while he was attempting to flirt with her, he did believe the contact it was consensual.

""She gave me her phone number. I considered that to be intimacy. It was 15 years ago. Me, drunk, at a party, with my hand on a girl's bum,"" he said.

He also accepted he had briefly appeared with a sock on his private parts in front of four colleagues in MasterChef studio. But he said his is not a flasher, and people were either ""amused or bemused"" but not distressed.

On the broader allegations about using inappropriate language, Wallace accepted the criticism and suggested that some of his conduct could be explained by his autism and his background.

""I know I am odd. I know I struggle to read people. I know people find me weird. Autism is a... registered disability. Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not real.""

He also blamed his former career: ""I'm a greengrocer from Peckham. I thrived in Covent Garden's fruit and veg market. In that environment that is jovial and crude. It is learned behaviour.""

Wallace told the newspaper he is now scared to appear in public: ""I go out now in a disguise - a baseball cap and sunglasses, I don't want people to see me. I'm scared.""

Crime commissioner apologises for claiming 'dead bodies' found in woodland,https://news.sky.com/story/crime-commissioner-apologises-for-claiming-dead-bodies-found-in-woodland-13401975,,Author not found,"A police and crime commissioner has apologised after claiming multiple human remains had been found in woodland during a murder investigation.

Alison Hernandez told a meeting of the Devon and Cornwall police and crime panel ""dead bodies"" had been found at Sticker, near St Austell.

She said investigations were ongoing to establish exactly how many had been found.

But Devon and Cornwall Police said the body of one man had been recovered from the woods and no other remains had been found.

Police and forensic experts have been carrying out extensive inquiries in the woodland since the discovery of the body of 43-year-old Daniel Coleman.

James Desborough, 39, is accused of murdering Mr Coleman between 2 June and 7 July. He is due back before Truro Crown Court next week.

Apologising, Ms Hernandez said: ""In trying to be helpful I responded to an operational question at the police and crime panel, however, I was not fully up to date with the facts of the investigation.

""I apologise for any alarm this may have caused.

""The police have operational primacy over these matters.

""I have oversight of all of these investigations at this time, and can confirm they are being carried out independently of each other and are not believed to be linked.

"Ghislaine Maxwell answered justice department questions 'about 100 different people', her lawyer says",https://news.sky.com/story/ghislaine-maxwell-answered-justice-department-questions-about-100-different-people-her-lawyer-says-13401865,,Author not found,"Ghislaine Maxwell answered ""every single question"" from the US justice department, her lawyer has said.

The imprisoned former girlfriend of convicted sex offenderJeffrey Epsteinanswered questions ""about 100 different people"" during one-and-a-half days of questioning in the federal courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida, her attorney David Oscar Markus said.

A senior administration official has confirmed to Sky News' US partner, NBC News, that Maxwell was granted limited immunity, meaning the information could not be used against her in any future cases or proceedings.

Mr Markus said Maxwell ""answered those questions honestly, truthfully, to the best of her ability"" when she met with deputy attorney general Todd Blanche.

""She never invoked a privilege. She never refused to answer a question, so we're very proud of her,"" Mr Markus added.

Maxwell,who was jailed in 2022for luring young girls to massage rooms for Epstein to abuse, is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Epstein, 66,was found dead in his cellat a Manhattan federal jail in August 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.

His case has generated endless attention and conspiracy theories due to his and Maxwell's links to famous people like royals, presidents and billionaires, includingDonald Trump.

Mr Trump is facing ongoing questions about the Epstein case. He denied prior knowledge of Epstein's crimes and claimed he cut off their relationship long ago.

The deputy US attorney general, Mr Blanche, announced earlier this week that Maxwell would be interviewed because of Mr Trump's directive to gather and release any credible evidence about others who may have committed crimes.

Maxwell's lawyer, Mr Markus, praised Mr Blanche's approach.

""The deputy attorney general is seeking the truth. He asked every possible question, and he was doing an amazing job,"" he said.

Maxwell's immunity from future proceedings is ""limited"" because it only covers her if she tells the truth. Typically, prosecutors will consider the defendant's cooperation in an investigation when recommending a lighter sentence as part of a plea deal.

But since Maxwell has already been convicted, it is not clear how she might benefit from the immunity.

Mr Markus said Maxwell did not receive anything in return for answering the questions, but he acknowledged that Mr Trump could pardon her. ""We hope he exercises that power in the right and just way,"" Mr Markus said.

When asked whether he had thought about a pardon or clemency for Maxwell, Mr Trump claimed he had not considered it.

""I'm allowed to do it, but it's something I have not thought about,"" he told reporters outside the White House.

He later shut down another question, saying: ""I don't want to talk about that.""

Meanwhile, Maxwell's family have suggested the disgraced British socialite could use ""government misconduct"" to challenge her imprisonment.

Her family have frequently claimed she ""did not receive a fair trial"", but legal appeals against her sex trafficking convictions have been rejected by the courts.

Judges previously dismissed arguments from Maxwell's lawyers that she ""should never have been prosecuted"" because of a""weird"" agreement drafted more than 15 years ago.

The family argue that Maxwell should have been protected under an agreement Epstein had entered with the US Department of Justice in 2007, which agreed not to prosecute any of his co-conspirators.

During her trial in 2021, Maxwell was described as ""dangerous"" by prosecutors, who told jurors about how she would entice vulnerable girls to go to Epstein's properties for him to sexually abuse.

In a statement, her family said: ""Our sister Ghislaine did not receive a fair trial. Her legal team continues to fight her case in the courts and will file its reply in short order to the government's opposition in the US Supreme Court."""

In an interview with Sky News, she spoke about how, if the ""incredible support"" throughout the tournament in Switzerland is matched by an incredible performance, that can ""bring us the win"" against Spain on Sunday.

But while progressing,the teamhas called out social media abuse after defenderJess Carter faced racism online.

Players usedwinning their first trophy in 2022as a springboard to lobby the government to advocate for more access to football for girls.

""I think that's the high purpose of women's football,"" Weigman told Sky News when asked about players as campaigners while achieving sporting excellence.

""Of course it's England and we want to win, but there's a bigger picture too, and of course we saw that last week that we said this is enough [on racism].

""With Jess leading that, and everyone's supporting. We need to send a message out because it's unacceptable and disgusting.

""And that shows also that the identity of the women's game, that yes we want to improve and we want to get the results, but that gives us a platform to hopefully make a little change, positive change in society, and that's what we go for too.""

Comebacks

It has been a challenging tournament on the pitch defending their European crown. The opening match waslost to Francebefore emphatic wins against the Netherlands and Wales took them into the knockout phase.

They were facing elimination against Sweden before coming back from 2-0 down to 2-2 beforewinning on penalties.

And they came even closer to being knocked out in the semi-final by Italy until Michelle Agyemang equalised in the 96th minute and Chloe Kelly struck the winner in extra time.

So how does Wiegman cope with the frenzied finishes?

""I'm never angry at the players because I know they give their best and they do everything to make it work,"" she said in our interview at the team's Zurich hotel.

""I'm just really proud of them. How we show up, how we step up when necessary and I just hope that we do a little bit earlier now.

""But first, the most important thing is that we play at our best because that makes the chance of winning as high as possible and we want that best outcome of course.""

The outcome in 2023 waslosing the World Cup final to Spain, and Sunday's game in Basel is a rematch.

""Spain is a very good country, they play very good football, but I think we're really good too, so we have our tactical plan ready,"" Wiegman said.

""We have to be at our best. Then if we are at our best we can win and the urgency is there to be our best to make that possible.""

Five finals

The double European champion has unprecedented managerial experience at her five international tournaments - only reaching the finals with the Netherlands and England.

""It's very special because playing a final is very special,"" Wiegman said. ""There are many teams in the competition and there is only a spot for two countries to play a final and it's very, very hard to get through to the final.

""So I feel grateful and I'm really, really excited to play another final with England. And yes, I've noticed a couple of things, what it does with the country.

""Of course, I already did that after the Euros, but also after the World Cup. So I'm excited about that too, of course.""

Super-subs

She can feel vindicated by the results, however much the clamour is to make substitutions earlier.

""I don't feel that resistance, I don't feel that because I'm in the game and we have our bubble,"" she said.

""And the only thing I'm focusing on is my bubble, everything outside I'm not focusing on and don't pay attention to.

""Of course there's pressure, of course when you're down or 2-0 down or 1-0 then there's pressure because you need to score a goal and then you make your subs and it's incredible that the subs make a difference.""

There was no response at the time to explain what Meta was doing - only to counter comments from the FA at the end of the week.

""We're surprised to read these comments [from Mr Bullingham] since we have been working directly with the FA and UEFA both before and during this tournament.

Crowds gathered at Prestwick Airport in Ayrshire amid amajor security operationfor theUS president'svisit.

Mr Trump told reporters: ""I like your prime minister. He's slightly more liberal than I am... but he's a good man... he got a trade deal done. It's a good deal for the UK.""

The pair are expected to discuss potential changes to the UK-US trade deal which came into force last month.

Trump left Air Force One to head to Turnberry, one of hisScottishgolf courses. Part of the trip will include the opening of another course in Aberdeenshire, billed as ""the greatest 36 holes in golf"".

""There's no place like Turnberry. It's the best, probably the best course in the world. And I would say Aberdeen is right up there,"" the US president said.

""Sean Conneryhelped get me the [planning] permits. If it weren't for Sean Connery, we wouldn't have those great courses,"" he added.

During the trip, President Trump will also hold discussions with Scotland's First MinisterJohn Swinneyand EU Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyen, who is keen to secure a trade deal with the US.

Mr Trump told reporters there was ""a good 50-50 chance"" of an agreement with the EU but added there were ""maybe 20 different"" sticking points.

EU diplomats say a deal could result in a broad 15% tariff on EU goods and half of the 30% Trump is threatening to impose by 1 August.

The US president touched on illegal immigration and gave European leaders a stark warning.

""You better get your act together or you're not going to have Europe anymore. You got to get your act together,"" he said.

Politics Live:Macron lays out plan for France to recognise a Palestinian state.

The new Failure to Travel policy means housing support will be removed from those who block transfer requests.

The Home Office said this will ""ensure individuals who are moved from hotels to suitable alternative accommodation must take it"".

They added: ""Those who refuse to move without a valid reason will now risk losing their housing and support. It is a firm but fair approach, aimed to end abuse of asylum support and contribute towards the closure of costly hotel accommodation.

""While the government has a duty to support all asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute in appropriate accommodation, the new policy establishes clear consequences for those who game the system whilst protecting the vulnerable.""

There would be several steps before stripping someone of accommodation - with it being a last resort, Sky News understands.

It follows a week of unrestoutside a hotel in Epping used to house asylum seekers.

Several demonstrations have been held outside the Bell Hotel since 13 July, after an asylum seeker was charged with allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl.

Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, from Ethiopia, denied sexually assaulting the 14-year-old girl at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court last week and will stand trial in August.

On Thursday Epping council unanimously voted to urge the government to shut the site.

Ministers are under pressure to restore order amid fears of further unrest, like that seen in Southport last summer.

Labour has pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, a move chancellor Rachel Reeveshas claimed will save £1bn a year.

However there is a question mark as to how this will be achieved as Channel Crossings continue to rise. Nearly 20,000 migrants made the journey to the UK inthe first six months of this year, a rise of almost 50% on the number crossing in 2024 and a new record for the first half of a year.

Ministers say they inherited a ""broken system"", with 400 hotels being used to accommodate asylum seekers at the peak of the crisis under the Tories, costing £9 million per day.

Minister for Border Security and Asylum, Dame Angela Eagle, said: ""We inherited an asylum system on the brink of collapse - mismanaged, under strain, and costing the public a fortune. We are getting a grip.

""We are working to close hotels, restore order, and put fairness and value for money at the heart of our asylum system. This government is making those necessary decisions to protect the taxpayer and uphold the integrity of our borders.

""These reforms to the Failure to Travel policy are another example of this government's action to transform the asylum accommodation system and crack down on those who abuse our system, so it operates fairly and saves the taxpayer money."""

The judge noted that during the attack, ""the CCTV shows you were smiling"", and said Kelyan's death was a ""senseless loss"" of another boy to the ""horrors ofknife crime"".

Marie Bokassa, Kelyan's mother, said later that the boys ""shattered an entire world"" in a statement read outside the court on her behalf.

Mother 'a broken soul' after murder

Prosecutor Tom Little KC previously told the Old Bailey that Kelyan was attacked ""almost instantaneously"" by the boys on the top deck.

The 14-year-old suffered a severed femoral artery during the attack, which happened in the middle of the afternoon in Woolwich Church Street, and died shortly after medics arrived.

Marie Bokassa, Kelyan's mother, described herself in a victim impact statement on Friday as ""a broken soul whose life changed forever the day my child's life was taken from me by another child"".

""I ask myself what has happened to those two boys that has resulted in that terrible act of violence and I cannot imagine how can they be so angry,"" she added.

""What they did was horrific and I do not know what has led them to do this and maybe I will never.

""That moment of violence may have lasted seconds but its consequences are eternal.""

She then told the court she had spent her son's 15th birthday at his graveside, and said she is scared to take public transport - particularly the 472 bus route, on which her son was killed.

""I feel judged,"" Ms Bokassa said, before adding: ""These two young boys took my son's life without hesitation, they will now have to face the consequences of their actions here today.

""My only hope is they get the help they need before they ever get released into society.""

Young people urged to stop carrying knives

Ms Bokassa said Kelyan's life ""was not theirs to take"" and pleaded with young people to stop carrying knives.

""I beg you to stop,"" she said. ""Before you raise that blade, think of your own mother, think of the mothers who will cry every night like I do, who will scream into her pillow, who will walk past her child's empty room and collapse with grief.

""Don't let a moment of anger steal your future. Don't let the streets raise you in a way your mother never would.""

Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Lee, whose team led the Metropolitan Police investigation, added: ""The harsh reality in London is that violence disproportionately affects young black men and boys.

""The fact we're seeing so many teenagers like Kelyan die should be at the forefront of the minds of every politician, every policy maker and everyone who wants better for children growing up in London.

""Without this collective effort, we won't be able to tackle knife crime in its entirety.""

Speaking after his death, Ms Bokassa said Kelyanhad been groomed by gangsfrom the age of six, and she was not surprised when she found out he was dead.

She said the pair had spent Christmas together, after he was previously in care for several years, but she was concerned he still had ""one foot in the streets"".

"Sir Keir Starmer is caught between Trump, Macron and MPs over Palestine recognition",https://news.sky.com/story/how-sir-keir-starmer-is-caught-between-trump-macron-and-mps-over-palestine-recognition-13401896,,,"Parliament may have shut up shop for a six-week summer break, but MPs and the French president are turning up the heat on Sir Keir Starmer over the Middle East.

More than one in three of all 650 MPs have written to the prime ministercalling on the UK to recognise a Palestinian stateat a United Nations conference next week.

In response to the call, his answer is essentially: Yes, but not yet.

That, of course, won't satisfy the 222 MPs backing an all-party letter to the PM penned by the Labour MP Sarah Champion.

The majority of names on the letter, predictably, are Labour, Lib Dem and SNP MPs. But there are some Tory big hitters too, including Father of the House Sir Edward Leigh and former cabinet minister Kit Malthouse.

Until now, the PM and foreign secretary David Lammy have argued that the gesture of recognising Palestine on its own won't end what Sir Keir himself calls ""the appalling scenes inGaza"".

But the pressure for recognition isn't just coming from MPs. French President Emmanuel Macron has saidFrance will recognise a Palestinian stateat the UN General Assembly in September.

Might Mr Macron - whose bromance with the PM during his state visit to the UK could not have been warmer - persuade Sir Keir to do the same? Possibly. He's not ruling it out.

But there's one big obstacle to Sir Keir bowing to the pressure from MPs and the French president. And that's the towering figure who's in Scotland this weekend: the golfing president of the United States.

WhenDonald Trumpwas asked about President Macron's vow to recognise Palestine in September, his response was brutal and bordering on condescending.

""What he says doesn't matter,"" the president told reporters at the White House as he headed for Air Force One. ""He's a very good guy. I like him, but that statement doesn't carry weight.""

Ouch! But the US president's unflinching support forIsraeliPrime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahuplaces Sir Keir in an awkward spot: Caught between the opposing stances of the French and US presidents.

The PM is, therefore, also under pressure from President Trump, and he won't want to fall out with him when he meets him this weekend. Hence, his carefully worded statement responding to the letter from the MPs.

Appearing to try and please the US and French presidents - and the large number of Labour MPs backing Sarah Champion's letter - Sir Keir said he's ""working on a pathway to peace"" in the Middle East.

He spoke of ""concrete steps"" to turn a ceasefire into a lasting peace and said recognition of a Palestinian state ""has to be one of those steps"", adding: ""I am unequivocal about that.""

And he concluded: ""But it must be part of a wider plan which ultimately results in a two-state solution and lasting security for Palestinians and Israelis.

""This is the way to ensure it is a tool of maximum utility to improve the lives of those who are suffering - which of course, will always be our ultimate goal.""

As well as his own statement, the PM issued a joint statement with President Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, both of whom have held talks with Sir Keir in the UK in the past fortnight.

That statement was tough, beginning: ""The time has come to end the war in Gaza.""

It went on: ""The humanitarian catastrophe that we are witnessing in Gaza must end now.""

Yet there's little sign of either the war or the humanitarian catastrophe ending any time soon.

And that means that throughout parliament's summer break, MPs will no doubt continue to turn up the heat on the PM."
Inside Jeremy Corbyn's new party: Is the Labour left making a comeback?,https://news.sky.com/story/inside-the-messy-launch-of-jeremy-corbyns-new-party-13401443,,,"It was a very messy start to what the left hoped could be the most exciting left-wing movement in modern times.

Jeremy Corbynfinally announced something Westminster had known for a while - that he waslaunching a new left-wing partywith the formerLabourMP Zarah Sultana to ""take on the rich and powerful"" and campaign for the redistribution of wealth.

Politics latest:Labour 'full of control freaks', says Corbyn

They released a joint statement saying the system had been ""rigged"" for too long and they would offer an alternative to the ""control freaks"" within Labour as well as the ""dangerously divisive"" politics ofReform UK.

It was a much slicker statement than earlier this month, when the young firebrand Zarah Sultana sent a statement only 10 minutes after a Zoom meeting where a loose discussion over the structure of the party had been agreed,stating she would leave Labourto join the new left-wing party.

Corbyn was so unhappy with this he only responded publicly two days later - his team described the timing of the announcement as ""unfortunate"". This inevitably led to claims of factualism and the long left tradition of splitism.

But even as the party is formally announced, it still lacks a name.

One insider closely connected to the new party's strategy told me: ""The problem is Jeremy listens to everyone and as a result things take longer, there are lots of deliberations - that's what's been holding things up.""

But most people are happy with the agreed structure, one senior politician in the party told me: ""I'm team both - Jeremy is the older statesman, and Zarah is the future of the party. We are thrilled to get Zarah and her social media followers.""

There's no doubt that while a lot has been done behind closed doors, the party does seem slightly in chaos.

Still to be worked out is the party branding, the logo, how they will be affiliated with other organisations, they haven't registered with the Electoral Commission, and one insider working on the communications side said they had wanted a big slick website before launching.

A big unknown is the issue of party donors.

They know they don't have the backing that other parties have, and they understand they require a lot of money to keep this all ticking along.

They confirmed they will have an inaugural conference sometime in the autumn and an assembly before that to decide on a few more things - potentially the name.

""Some people want a pre-conference to decide all of these things, but it will be decided by the same group that decided that Jeremy and Zarah should co-lead.""

What they do have going for them is support, even at this early stage.

Jeremy Corbyn told me they have an average of 500 people per minute signing up and only five hours after their official launch, they had 80,000 members.

And when you hear them talk about what the party will do, you can understand why. It's a list of where they think the government has failed. And that list is long:personal independence payment (PIP),the welfare rebellion,winter fuel chaosand above everything else,Gaza.

Timing in politics is everything and the Labour left are seizing on a bit of a moment. One year on from Labour's loveless landslide,the cracks are forming.

One member who was included in the new party's earliest Zoom calls said they understand where they might have success: ""There's a lot of appetite for an anti-establishment movement that doesn't bash migrants. The Labour Party has left a massive gap when it abandoned people on immigration and Palestine.""

Another left-wing activist still in the party says it's only capturing people who got kicked out of the party anyway.

But Labour gave the most withering response of all. A source said: ""The electorate has twice given its verdict on a Jeremy Corbyn-led party.""

As we go into recess, it's clear what all this organisation is about.

Someone on the organisation committee told me they've been gearing up for next year's local elections for a while now.

They've been speaking to independent groups and formed a sub-committee of councillors with about 200 people already on board.

A vice chair of this group described themselves to me as ""foot soldiers waiting for their orders"". The new party expects Labour to get a hammering or, in their words, they think ""Labour is f*****"".

At the last locals, Reform got a boost and this time the left think it's theirs for the taking.

""You can't make things happen overnight, look at Reform who came out of UKIP - these things don't come out of nowhere.""

Epstein questions keep coming as White House tightens its grip on who can answer them,https://news.sky.com/story/epstein-questions-keep-coming-as-white-house-tightens-its-grip-on-who-can-answer-them-13401333,,,"Another day, another headline about Jeffrey Epstein for the White House to contend with.

The Wall Street Journalhas reportedthat US attorney general Pam Bondi met withPresident Trumpin May to inform him that his name appears multiple times in files related toJeffrey Epstein, who took his own life while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in 2019.

While the appearance of anyone's name in the files would not in itself indicate wrongdoing, it adds fuel to the fire of those peddling a conspiracy of the president's own making.

Trump latest:Questions hang over Ghislaine Maxwell meeting

During the election campaign, he implied the Biden administration was concealing something in the Epstein files and vowed to release them.

Once elected, his Department of Justice said it had reviewed the files and there was nothing to see.

In a clumsy attempt to shut down questions from their own base, they shifted the focus to the question of Donald Trump's own relationship with Epstein.

The two were friends in the nineties and noughties with Trump flying several times on Epstein's plane according to flight records. Again, there is no indication of any wrongdoing.

Three times in two weeks though, the president has attempted to quell the media storm.

He did a U-turn and ordered the release of grand jury testimony related to Epstein. A judge hasdeclined that request, ruling it doesn't meet the bar.

Hefiled a lawsuitagainst Rupert Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal for a report alleging he had sent a suggestive birthday letter to Epstein, something Trump calls ""fake news"".

And he gave his seal of approval to the justice department's decision to meet with Epstein's former girlfriend and accomplice, the jailed Ghislaine Maxwell.

So Ofwat, the embattled current regulator,is to be swept awayon the tide of public anger atsewage outflowsand shareholder dividends, and the disgruntlement of all its stakeholders.

Having succeeded in its primary aim of keeping consumer bills down, it is now a victim of the consequences: a shortage of investment in infrastructure and a failure to apply similar rigour to shareholder dividends and executive pay.

While campaigners and customers say it has failed to hold companies to account, the companies complain they are too tightly controlled to attract investment.

Ofwat privately points out it can only apply the powers and political direction it is given - but the new government, going with the flow of angry voters, will not hesitate to pull the chain.

Doctors' strike - what's different this time?,https://news.sky.com/story/doctors-strike-whats-different-this-time-13401293,,Author not found,"👉 Listen to Sky News Daily on your podcast app 👈

Thousands of resident doctors, formerly known as junior doctors, are due to strike for five days from Friday morning.

The doctors' union, the British Medical Association, is calling for a pay rise of 29.2% to reverse ""pay erosion"" since 2008/09. The government has offered 5.4%.

In previous strikes, around 1.5 million appointments were cancelled or rescheduled, but this time hospitals have been told to cancel non-urgent work only in ""exceptional circumstances"".

In today's episode, Niall Paterson talks to Sky's health correspondent Ashish Joshi about how the NHS will deal with the walkout and also to resident doctor Bhasha Mukherjee about why she voted for strike action.

Grammy-winning jazz singer Dame Cleo Laine dies,https://news.sky.com/story/grammy-winning-jazz-singer-dame-cleo-laine-dies-13401823,,Author not found,"Grammy-winning jazz singer Dame Cleo Laine has died aged 97.

Dame Cleo was a leading figure of the British jazz scene for many years and worked with the likes of Ray Charles and Frank Sinatra.

Her famed scat singing style, her remarkable range from tenor to contralto and her smoky voice made her Britain's most successful jazz singer, earning her the nickname the First Lady of Jazz.

""It is with deepest sadness that we announce the passing of our dearly beloved mother, Cleo, who died peacefully yesterday afternoon,"" her children Jacqui and Alec Dankworth said.

""We will all miss her terribly. The family wish to be given space to grieve and ask for privacy at this very difficult time.""

Dame Cleo's husband, saxophonist Sir John Dankworth, died aged 82 in 2010 after being a mainstay of the British jazz scene for more than 50 years.

The couple founded a charity and venue called The Stables in 1970 to ""ensure young people have access to great music and music education"", David Meadowcroft, chairman of the charity, said, adding that The Stables would continue the couple's commitment.

He added that Dame Cleo ""was a remarkable performer who was loved by audiences around the world"".

Monica Ferguson, artistic director of The Stables, said the singer ""will be greatly missed, but her unique talent will always be remembered"".

Born Clementina Dinah Campbell, the singer grew up with her Jamaican father and English mother in Southall, west London, where she was supported by her father's busking talents.

She became a professional jazz singer in her mid-20s when she successfully auditioned for the Johnny Dankworth Seven in 1951 and changed her name to Cleo Laine.

Seven years later, Dame Cleo married Sir John. Their son Alec was born in 1960, a year before his mother scored a top 10 hit with You'll Answer To Me, before daughter Jacqueline followed in 1963.

In 1973, Dame Cleo and Sir John drew a sold-out crowd at New York's Carnegie Hall and launched a series of popular concerts.

She received a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance for Cleo At Carnegie in 1986.

"Riverdance star Michael Flatley to make bid for Irish presidency, court hears",https://news.sky.com/story/riverdance-star-michael-flatley-to-make-bid-for-irish-presidency-court-hears-13401658,,Author not found,"Riverdance star Michael Flatley is hoping to become Ireland's next president, a court has heard.

The revelation came out in a legal case over work done on his mansion in County Cork, the Castlehyde.

Barrister Ronnie Hudson said there had been a ""material change in circumstances"" for Flatley and he's set to move back to Ireland in the next two weeks in the hope of running in autumn's election.

A legal statement signed by the star's solicitor, Maxwell Mooney, was also submitted to the High Court stating Flatley would ""seek nominations to run for president of Ireland"".

Flatley rose to fame when Riverdance, which features traditional Irish music and dance, became a phenomenon in the 1990s and went on to tour the world. It continues to be performed today.

The choreographer and dancer also created and starred in Lord Of The Dance.

The 67-year-old - who currently lives in Monaco - strongly hinted at a presidential bid last week, but said he hadn't made a final decision.

The role of president inIrelandis largely ceremonial and is currently held by Michael D Higgins, whose term ends on 11 November.

The election is expected to take place at the end of October.

A candidate needs nominations from at least 20 members of the Irish parliament or at least four local authorities.

Those who've already met the criteria are former farming journalist and EU commissioner Mairead McGuinness, and former Galway mayor Catherine Connolly.

Former MMA fighter Conor McGregor is among others who have alsohinted they might run- although the prospect was universally rejected by other politicians in Ireland."
New internet rules enforced from today - but this grieving mother is sceptical they will work,https://news.sky.com/story/new-internet-rules-enforced-from-today-but-this-grieving-mother-is-sceptical-they-will-work-13401388,,Mickey Carroll,"""People always think: 'Oh, that's not going to happen to me, it's not going to happen to my child,'"" says Ellen Roome.

She's sitting in her peaceful garden in Cheltenham, bumblebees trundling around in the bushes behind her.

""I didn't expect it to be my child.""

Jools, Ellen's son, was 14 years old when he took his life in 2022. It's thought he had been watching harmful content online when he died.

Ellen was the one who found him.

Jools was funny, into martial arts - in fact, he was a black belt in kung fu at just 10 years old - and he was popular.

This weekend, his school friends are all heading to Ellen's house to help her mark what should be his 18th.

They come every year to celebrate his birthday, and there are signs of how loved he is all over the house - pictures, a small wooden dinghy painted red in the garden, his name written down the side in curly script.

When Jools passed away, Ellen became part of a small but growing group of parents in the UK whose children have died after seeing harmful content on the internet.

Today, Ofcom, the communications regulator, begins enforcing new rules to protect the UK's children online.

'New rules don't go far enough'

The new rules mean ""highly effective"" age verification systems must be in place on pornographic content, and social media algorithms must be altered to stop harmful content popping up on young people's feeds.

But Ellen, and many of the bereaved parents she campaigns with, aren't satisfied - for them, the rules don't go far enough.

""At the moment, you've got massive gaps still where it's not safe,"" she says.

""Online platforms are having to do age verification. Is that going to work? Children are quite clever. They find loopholes of how to get around these things.""

Teens: Internet a 'malicious place'

She's not alone in her scepticism.

More than a hundred miles away in a Warrington youth club, a group of 15 teenagers have given up one of their first afternoons of summer holidays to talk about what they've seen online.

When asked if they've seen harmful or inappropriate content online, one of them, a 17-year-old called Amy, replies: ""More than I can count.""

When she describes the things she has been sent or scrolled through on social media, it's clear she's not exaggerating.

Ryan, another 17-year-old, nonchalantly describes the internet as a ""very, very malicious place"".

""If you're going into an online space and you're expecting simplicity and everything to be nice and tame, you're going in quite naive,"" he says.

Lucas and his twin brother are just 12 years old and even they've seen language that ""can be quite explicit for children around my age"", he says.

But the young people here at Warrington Youth Zone aren't all convinced these new rules are going to make a difference.

Many of them assume their peers will just find ways around the content controls.

""If people are that determined to have an over-18s account, nothing is really going to stop them,"" says 15-year-old Freya.

Warning of 'steep sanctions'

Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, is more optimistic.

""This is a moment where the safety of children online is going to take the biggest step forward since the creation of the internet,"" he told Sky News.

""Finally, we [have] platforms who are having to verify people's age before they access material and there will be very steep sanctions if material finds its way into children's hands and it is inappropriate,"" he says.

He's proud of these new regulations; they are the first of their kind in this country.

Not only are there much stricter rules in place, Ofcom, the communications regulator, also has significant powers if companies don't comply.

Plenty of cynicism about checks

It can impose fines of up to £18m or 10% of revenue and, in very serious cases, stop sites operating in the UK, all in the name of cleaning up the internet ""cesspit"" he says the UK's children have become used to.

""It is indistinguishable for them as to what's going to come up next [in their feeds].

""They don't know whether it's going to be something healthy that they want to see or whether it is something criminally violent or exploitative or damaging.""

There's plenty of cynicism about these new rules.

Some people are suspicious about privacy. ""Highly effective"" age verification can include bank or ID checks or even AI tools that estimate people's ages.

The chief executive of Yoti, one of the companies now offering these age-checking tools, says he would be ""out of business"" if he didn’t look after users' data.

Robin Tombs added: ""Over time, people will get comfortable [and] trust that if it is well-regulated, you can do this with privacy.""

Criminalisation of children?

Others worry that more teenagers will end up being criminalised.

Marcus Johnstone, a lawyer who specialises in sexual crimes, says: ""You're not going to be able to stop teenagers watching pornography.""

""The schools, the colleges they're at, everybody's watching pornography so they will want access to that.

""It will result in criminalisation of more young people because they will want to find that material and if it's not available on the easy access sites where they might find it now, then they will go on to the illegal sites.""

Ofcom's response to that concern was that these rules are about creating societal change as much as technological blocks on content.

""It's about what we as a society say is normal for our online experiences,"" says Jessica Smith, online safety principal at the regulator.

Others, like Ellen, want the rules to go much further.

She supports an all-out ban of under-18s on social media, saying an Australia-style ban of under-16s doesn't go far enough.

""At 16, you're still quite naive and young. I remember thinking I was very mature at 16. Looking back, I really wasn't,"" she says.

Peter Kyle, while celebrating the new rules, is realistic.

""I am not telling every parent out there that [from today], every single corner of the internet is going to be safe for their kids to be on, or that some content won't slip through.

""But what I am saying is that I am expecting a step change in children's experience.

""They will notice the difference. For the first time since the creation of the internet, parents and children will notice a difference in their online experience.""

Dozens dead as storm sweeps through the Philippines,https://news.sky.com/story/tropical-storm-sweeps-through-the-philippines-leaving-at-least-25-dead-13401780,,Author not found,"A fierce tropical storm has torn through the Philippines' mountainous north, in a week which has already seen floods and landslides claim at least 25 lives.

Typhoon Co-may struck the town of Agno in Pangasinan province Thursday night with winds reaching speeds of 120 kilometres (74 miles) per hour. By Friday afternoon, as it moved northeast, the typhoon had weakened slightly.

Co-may struck after seasonal monsoon rains drenched a vast part of the country for over a week. More than a dozen additional tropical storms are expected to strike the Southeast Asian nation before the end of the year, forecasts show.

At least 25 deaths have been reported since last weekend, mostly due to flash floods, toppled trees, landslides, and electrocution, according to officials. A further eight people have been reported missing.

Schools in the capital, Manila, remained closed for the third consecutive day on Friday, with classes also suspended in 35 provinces across the main northern region of Luzon. Over 80 towns and cities, mostly in Luzon, have declared a state of calamity, enabling quicker access to emergency funds and the freezing of prices on essential goods.

The weather has forced 278,000 people to seek refuge in emergency shelters or with relatives. According to the government's disaster response agency, close to 3,000 homes have suffered damage.

Thousands of military personnel, police officers, coast guard members, firefighters, and civilian volunteers have been deployed to assist in rescuing residents.

"Thousands of cancer cases could be prevented with more breast removal surgeries, study suggests",https://news.sky.com/story/thousands-of-cancer-cases-could-be-prevented-with-more-breast-removal-surgeries-study-suggests-13401269,,Author not found,"Thousands of cancer cases could potentially be prevented if more women were offered breast removal surgery, according to a study.

A mastectomy is offered to some people who already have breastcancer, but research suggests about 6,500 cases could be prevented each year if more preventative procedures were done.

Risk-reducing mastectomies (RRM) are currently only an option for women with the BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 genes.

But the study says people with other genes - including ATM, CHEK2, RAD51C, RAD51D - might benefit if they also have other high-risk factors.

These include family history of the disease, whether they breast fed, mammogram density and the number of children they've had.

Researchers suggest that if all women 30 to 55 with a risk of 35% or more could be identified - and they all then had RRM - an estimated 6,538 cases could be prevented each year.

That equates to about 11% of the 59,000 UK women diagnosed annually.

The economic evaluation by Queen Mary University of London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) said it would be a cost effective strategy.

It added that women carrying one of the other genes linked to breast cancer could potentially be found by ""cascade testing"", in which tests are offered to family members.

One of the authors said it was the first time a risk factor for offering RRM had been defined.

""Our results could have significant clinical implications to expand access to mastectomy beyond those patients with known genetic susceptibility in high penetrance genes - BRCA1/ BRCA2/ PALB2 - who are traditionally offered this,"" said Professor Ranjit Manchanda, professor of gynaecological oncology at Queen Mary.

""We recommend that more research is carried out to evaluate the acceptability, uptake, and long-term outcomes of RRM among this group,"" he added.

Louise Grimsdell, Breast Cancer Now senior clinical nurse specialist, stressed that women should consider all options - not just surgery.

""While this modelling provides valuable insights into the cost-effectiveness of risk-reducing mastectomy for women with a high risk of developing breast cancer, each individual must be offered all risk-management options that are suitable for them,"" she said.

""Choosing to have risk-reducing surgery is a complex and deeply personal decision that comes with emotional and physical implications,"" added Ms Grimsdell.

""So, it's vital women can consider all their options, including screening and risk-reducing medications, and are supported by their clinician to make an informed decision that's right for them.

""It's also crucial that the unacceptably long waits that far too many women who chose risk-reducing surgery are facing are urgently tackled.""

The new blueprint is designed to speed up the building of energy-intensive data centres - which runAIproducts - by loosening environmental rules, while also vastly expanding the sale of AI technologies overseas.

The plan, which includes 90 recommendations, comes as America attempts to maintain its edge over China, with both superpowers investing heavily in the industry to secure economic and military superiority.

It calls for the export of US AI software and hardware abroad, as well as urging the removal of ""red tape"" that could be seen as stopping the industry from flourishing.

In a speech in Washington DC,Mr Trumpsaid: ""America is the country that started the AI race. And as president of the United States, I'm here today to declare that America is going to win it.""

He said the technological arms race with China was a fight that will define the 21st century.

The president added: ""We also have to have a single federal standard, not 50 different states regulating this industry in the future.""
