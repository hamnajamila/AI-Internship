What went wrong?Trump's 25% tariff strike on Indian goods with more penalties in the pipeline lands just as Indian PM Modi told Parliament that Trump had no hand in truce with Pakistan, undercutting US President's narrative.","The US-India trade deal is now on ice.

Hours after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi dismissed claims in the country’s Parliament that Washington played a role in the India-Pakistan ceasefire, US President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on Indian goods, with more penalties to come, this time linked to India's oil and defence trade with Russia.

""India is our friend,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday, before accusing the country of setting tariffs ""far too high"" and helping fuel Russia's war in Ukraine by continuing to buy oil and weapons from Moscow.

""Remember, while India is our friend... we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the world. And they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers of any country.""

The Indian government responded with a short statement saying it was reviewing the move.

But the timing of the announcement has raised questions in both capitals and among trade negotiators who had just completed their fifth round of talks aimed at wrapping up a deal by the end of the year.

New Delhi had framed those talks as constructive. Trump's tariff decision caught Indian officials off guard, according to people briefed on the matter.

India at a disadvantage?

The breakdown comes as political tensions between the two sides have quietly resurfaced.

Modi, during public remarks in recent days, has repeatedly said the ceasefire between New Delhi and Islamabad was brokered without help from the United States, a statement that directly contradicts accounts from Trump.

Following the brief conflict between India and Pakistan in May, which the US stated threatened to escalate into a nuclear exchange, Trump and his administration have claimed nearly 30 times that the US brokered the ceasefire.

Islamabad has acknowledged the US's role and even nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, but New Delhi denies it, with Modi telling Indian Parliament, ""No world leader asked us to stop the operation.""

Trade had long been seen as a stabilising pillar in the US-India relationship. But fault lines remain. Washington wants full market access for American agricultural and technology exports. India has pushed back, citing domestic industries, especially dairy and farming.

India is currently one of America's largest trading partners but the trade imbalance stands at nearly $46 billion, in India's favour. That figure, along with India's deepening ties with Russia, and Modi's refusal to accept US role in truce with Pakistan appears to have made New Delhi a target in Trump's wider tariff strategy, which also includes new duties on Brazil.

The tariff escalation puts India at a disadvantage compared to countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh, where exporters already benefit from lower costs and fewer restrictions.

Indian trade bodies warned that demand for Indian goods could dip sharply unless clarity on the penalties emerges soon.

US, Pakistan strike 'massive oil reserves' deal

India's main opposition party, Congress, blasted Modi government over the tariff announcement by the US. In a post on X, the Congress party wrote, ""Trump slapped a 25% tariff on India, along with a penalty. The country is now bearing the cost of Narendra Modi's 'friendship'. Modi campaigned for Trump, hugged him eagerly, posed for photos, and made it trend on social media. In the end, Trump still imposed tariffs on India. India's foreign policy has completely failed.""

Despite months of rhetoric about deepening economic ties and shared Asia-Pacific goals, the US and India are now drifting on key fronts — energy, defence, sanctions, and now trade.After imposing tariffs on New Delhi, Trump announced that his administration has struck a trade deal with Pakistan as talks continue with other nations, ahead of his self-imposed August 1 deadline.

The US President added that an American company will develop Pakistan's (newly discovered) massive oil reserves.

""Maybe they'll be selling oil to India some day,"" Trump added.

Although trade negotiations between the US and India haven't formally ended, the latest move by Trump, layered with geopolitics and public messaging, has left both sides with less room to manoeuvre and more distance than either expected."

In late-night court filings on Tuesday, US federal prosecutors said unsealing the materials would be appropriate given the ""abundant public interest"" in the case of Epstein, the late financier, and Maxwell, an imprisoned British socialite.

The Republican Trump had promised to make public Epstein-related files if reelected and accused Democrats of covering up the truth. But this month the Department of Justice said a previously touted Epstein client list did not in fact exist, angering Trump's supporters.

DOJ first sought court permission on July 18 to make public transcripts of the confidential testimony given by witnesses years ago in the two cases, but Manhattan-based District Judges Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer asked the government to flesh out the legal bases for the requests.

Trump has faced pressure to make public documents from the federal investigations into Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, and his longtime girlfriend Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021.

Even if one or both of the judges allow the transcripts to be made public, it is not clear whether the public would learn anything new or noteworthy.

In the filings, prosecutors said the only witness at Epstein's grand jury was an FBI agent. That same agent and a New York City Police Department detective were the only witnesses at Maxwell's grand jury, prosecutors said.

Maxwell's four-week trial in 2021 included public testimony from alleged sex trafficking victims, associates of Epstein and Maxwell, and law enforcement officers.

She is now serving a 20-year prison sentence in Florida and is asking the US Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. She had pleaded not guilty.

The unsealing requests came after Trump earlier this month asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury transcripts. The president did so after the Justice Department said it concluded that Epstein died by suicide and that there was no incriminating list of his clients.

The Justice Department's announcement angered some of Trump's conservative supporters who believe the government is covering up Epstein's ties to the rich and powerful and that the financier was murdered in jail.

Grand juries are convened by prosecutors and meet in secret to hear witness testimony and decide whether to indict people suspected of crimes. Records of their proceedings usually remain sealed. There are only limited circumstances under which such transcripts can be disclosed.

The transcripts would not represent all previously unreleased material in the government's possession.

Investigators and prosecutors may pursue leads that they cannot substantiate or interview potential witnesses whom they do not ultimately call to testify before a grand jury.

US District Judge Robin Rosenberg in Florida last week denied the administration's request to unseal records from grand jury probes in 2005 and 2007 in that state into Epstein. The judge said the request did not fall into any of the limited exceptions that may allow for the release of such material.

Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to a prostitution charge brought under Florida law and was given a 13-month sentence in a deal with prosecutors now widely regarded as too lenient.

Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche, Trump's former personal lawyer, last week met with Maxwell to see if she had any information about others who had committed crimes.

Maxwell's lawyer David Markus and Blanche have not provided detailed accounts of their discussions.

Democrats use 'rule of five'

Meanwhile, Democrats moved on Wednesday to force Trump to release files from the investigation into Epstein, invoking an obscure law to keep up the pressure on an issue that has roiled the US president's administration.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee wrote to the Justice Department asking for the materials under a section of federal law known as the ""rule of five.""

The measure — introduced a century ago but rarely used — requires government departments to provide relevant information if any five members of the Senate's chief watchdog panel request it.

It is not clear if it could be enforced in court but even if the effort fails it keeps the spotlight on an issue that has upended Trump's summer, dividing Republicans and leading to the early closure of the House of Representatives.

Democrats in Congress — with limited Republican support — have been seeking a floor vote to force the release of Epstein files.

House Oversight Committee Democrats, backed by some Republicans, approved a subpoena last week for the Justice Department to hand over the documents, although the demand has yet to be sent."
Date not found,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/3007b0ea4c90,Can Apple’s $500M rare earth deal help the US shake off its dependence on China?,"Apple has signed a $500 million agreement with MP Materials for rare earth magnets, aiming to mitigate supply risks following China’s export restrictions earlier this year.

The company last week secured backing from the Pentagon – the US Department of Defense – which will become its largest shareholder.

The deal marks a significant victory for MP Materials, the only American rare earths mine operator, whose shares jumped by 20 percent as a result.

Earlier this year, US President Donald Trump invoked emergency powers to boost domestic production of critical minerals, aiming to counterbalance China’s overwhelming dominance in the industry.

“Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said this month.

“We couldn’t be more excited about the future of American manufacturing, and we will continue to invest in the ingenuity, creativity, and innovative spirit of the American people.”

But even with this high-profile deal, China still processes nearly 90 percent of the world’s rare earths, and about two-thirds of American-mined minerals are shipped to China for refining before they can be used in products like Apple’s.

China’s control over the sector extends directly to MP Materials through Shenghe Resources, which has held roughly an eight percent stake in the company. For years, MP had been sending the majority of its ore to China for processing.

Now, the US Department of Defense has an effective 15 percent stake in MP by purchasing half a billion dollars in preferred stock along with warrants.

The company has pledged it will no longer send any material to China for processing.

“We're getting an important national security need met, but we're maintaining our free market public company approach,” MP's CEO James Litinsky told an investor call.

The deal marks a significant step toward reshoring critical processing capabilities, but it also raises a broader question about whether such efforts can truly shift the balance.

A long road to independence

While American officials and industry leaders are keen to celebrate the latest MP Materials deal as a turning point, experts caution that it is only one step on a much longer journey.

China’s overwhelming dominance in rare earth processing and refining means the US still faces enormous structural obstacles.

According to Jack Lifton, Senior Fellow at the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security, the fundamental landscape has shifted beyond what most Western policymakers anticipated.

“What’s changed is the advent of truly global competition,” Lifton tells TRT World. “Americans and Europeans are very, very late—too late—to this game.”

Now it is not just a matter of catching up in mining or extraction.

As outlined in reports from the Hinrich Foundation, even if American mining output increases, most of those minerals still end up in Chinese refineries before they can reach US factories.

Steve Christensen, executive director of the Responsible Battery Coalition, welcomes the new investments, but recognises the limitations.

“Expanding extraction is great, and we need more of it and investments along the value chain,” said Christensen, executive director of the Responsible Battery Coalition, an association representing battery makers, automakers and battery sellers.

“The metals produced from MP will lessen our dependence on China”.

Yet, the challenges go well beyond the supply chain.

Lifton points out that now countries in the Middle East, South America, and Africa are increasingly determined to keep more of the economic benefits from their own mineral resources, rather than settling for quick profits.

In other words, the global landscape for critical minerals is evolving quickly, with China prepared to offer its processing technology in exchange for continued influence.

“American and European companies cannot compete at this level,” Lifton says.

Policy changes in Washington have tried to address some of these gaps.

President Trump’s emergency orders and the Ocean Shipping Reform Act are attempts to make American supply chains more resilient.

However, reports reveal that regulatory and environmental struggles mean that even approved mining projects in the US can take decades to come into effect.

""The US has the second-longest lead time globally (29 years) from discovery to production,” the S&P Global report writes.

Most evidence suggests that even with more investment, American efforts will take years—if not decades—to match the scale and sophistication of China’s network.

As the experts discuss, success will require a coordinated approach, long-term investment, and a willingness to work alongside partners in the Global South, rather than relying solely on domestic solutions."

The High Court has granted permission to Huda Ammori, co-founder of Palestine Action, to bring a full judicial review against the order of Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, banning the group as a terrorist organisation.

In June, Cooper announced a ban under the Terrorism Act 2000 after activists spray-painted planes at a Royal Air Force base, an act being investigated under counter-terrorism laws.

Later, the ban was passed in the House of Commons and the House of Lords earlier this month.

During Wednesday's hearing, the court ruled that several of the grounds that Palestine Action presented to the court as to why the government's actions were unreasonable were upheld.

Justice Martin Chamberlain said he had decided that two parts of the arguments on Ammori's behalf were ""reasonably arguable.""

""The proscription order is likely to give rise to interference with rights guaranteed by common law and Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights,"" he added.

Lawyers for Ammori previously told the High Court the decision was ""so extreme as to render the UK an international outlier.""

British lawmakers voted to list Palestine Action as a terrorist group, making it a criminal offence to be a member of the group or to invite or recklessly express support for it. One can be punished for up to 14 years in prison if they belong to or support the group.

In early July, a group of more than 400 cultural figures had urged the government to step back from its intention to ban Palestine Action and to ""stop arming Israel.""

Recently, the UN human rights chief, Volker Turk, raised serious concerns over the ban, warning it is a ""disturbing misuse"" of counter-terrorism laws and risks undermining fundamental freedoms."
Date not found,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/ab3b547974fc,Temples or treason? Reasons that led to the Cambodia-Thailand flare-up,"A century-old border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia flared into deadly clashes last week, with rocket strikes, air raids, and landmines leaving civilians dead on both sides of the border, and thousands displaced.

Fighting peaked just before a ceasefire was brokered by Malaysia’s leader Anwar Ibrahim, requiring both sides to withdraw troops and accept international monitoring.

Many suspect that behind-the-scenes issues are fuelling the current dispute.

From a rift between Thailand’s and Cambodia’s ruling families, the Shinawatras and the Huns, to shifting dynamics in money laundering and scam operations along the border, are adding to the tensions, according to Patinya Ambuel, a Thai-American analyst.

Thaksin Shinawatra, former Prime Minister of Thailand and father of acting Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra (who was suspended after a leaked phone call with Cambodia’s former PM Hun Sen), has long maintained close ties with Hun Sen, whose son Hun Manet now leads Cambodia.

That friendship appears to have broken down recently, and that rupture is what experts cite as a major factor in the current flare-up.

Evidence of the fallout includes the leaked phone call between Hun Sen and Paetongtarn, in which she allegedly offered to act against a Thai military officer at the Cambodian leader’s request. Thaksin reportedly saw the leak as a betrayal. “I never imagined someone so close could act this way.” However, Hun Sen also feels betrayed by the former Thai leader.

While both sides accuse each other of betrayal, many in Thailand, including top officials, view Paetongtarn’s remarks as bordering on treason.

Thai court suspends PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra, centre, from duty pending case seeking her dismissal.

More factors seem to emerge as contributing to the conflict between two once-friendly neighbours.

Upsetting casinos, “scam centres”?

Among the potential sources of conflict is Thailand’s plan to open casinos and “entertainment centres” near the Cambodian border, something that may have angered Hun Sen, Ambuel says.

Currently, there are casinos just across the Thai border in Cambodia, frequented especially by Thais and Chinese. This would be a loss of revenue for Cambodia, as well as a loss of lucrative money laundering operations, she adds.

The issue of money always causes rifts in any conflict, according to her. Thailand’s proposal to open casino businesses might be angering Hun Sen, as shady financial activities from Thailand would no longer need to siphon through Cambodia’s casinos for laundering, not to mention the loss of huge casino earnings.

In addition, growing pressure on the Thai government to crack down on scam centres, an issue not just for Bangkok but the international community, may also be contributing to the feud, Ambuel adds.

In these scam centres, criminal gangs have trafficked hundreds of thousands of people and forced them to conduct online and telephone fraud, generating billions of dollars annually, according to the UN. In March, Thailand, a supplier of electricity and internet to some of these operations, led a crackdown on several centres.

Rising nationalist sentiment on both sides may also be inflaming tensions.

Ambuel refers to the possibility that Hun Sen may be trying to drum up some nationalist sentiment to help quash any potential opposition to his son’s government and Thai army’s likely eagerness to play up nationalism to run down calls for a military reform.

While Thais have their own corrupt leadership, according to some rumours, the unpopular Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Manet “created a situation to distract the country from his socio-economic failure,” says Ambuel.

While some Western media coverage links the conflict to US-China rivalry, the roots of the Cambodia-Thailand dispute go back to the Franco-Siamese treaties of 1904 and 1907, which defined the boundary between then-Siam and French Indochina, according to Dan Steinbock, a leading economist and political analyst on China and South Asian politics.

Siam refers to modern-day Thailand, while French Indochina encompassed present-day Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

Like many of the world’s international borders, the Thai-Cambodian boundary was drawn by colonial Western powers without regard to native populations and their social, economic, or cultural landmarks, including sites of their ancient temples like Preah Vihear.

“It is these colonial legacies that overshadow the present conflict,” Steinbock tells TRT World.

Preah Vihear is currently located in Cambodia, but Thailand claims the temple should be part of its territory.

Beyond Preah Vihear, several other areas are also disputed, according to Ambuel. In 1959, Cambodia brought the temple issue to the International Court of Justice, which ruled in Cambodia’s favour in 1962.

The political status of two other temples: Angkor Wat and Prasat Ta Moan Thom (which means “Great Temple of Grandfather Chicken”), also remains a source of fierce disagreement.

“Border tensions have persisted, especially after Cambodia applied for World Heritage status for Preah Vihear,” Ambuel tells TRT World.

Angkor Wat is located in Cambodia near the Thai border, while Prasat Ta Moan Thom is located in Thailand, close to the Cambodian border.

According to Steinbock, since the Biden administration, Washington has increasingly portrayed Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, in “Cold War-style win-lose terms,” beginning with the US military pivot to the region over a decade ago. He says that the term “Asia” itself has been replaced by “Indo-Pacific.”

“When economies struggle and geopolitics hovers over peaceful development, legacy conflicts thrive. This was the case during the Cold War, which some powers would like to triumph today as well,” says Steinbock, referring to possible US involvement and adding that both Thailand and Cambodia are among the top five nations affected by Trump’s tariffs.

In the process, many colonial legacy conflicts in Asia have been redefined as if they were a part of this new rivalry, including the Thailand-Cambodia border friction, as if it could be separated from its French colonial past, he adds.

While Southeast Asia and China are currently working towards stability through ASEAN-China Code of Conduct talks, Steinbock says external forces like the US are undermining the region’s efforts towards economic integration, favouring divisive geopolitics over cooperation."
7/30/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/2d4e23149d95,Thailand accuses Cambodia of second ceasefire violation in two days,"Thailand’s military accused Cambodian forces on Wednesday of breaching a ceasefire agreement at three separate locations along the disputed border, warning that continued aggression could compel Thai forces to respond more decisively.

The allegations come less than two days after both governments agreed to a ceasefire brokered in Malaysia, which came into effect at midnight on Monday, aimed to stop fighting in their deadliest conflict in more than a decade following five days of intense fighting.

It killed at least 43 people and displaced over 300,000 civilians on either side.

The truce came after a sustained push from Malaysian Premier Anwar Ibrahim and US President Donald Trump, with the latter warning Thai and Cambodian leaders that trade negotiations would not progress if fighting continued.

Thailand and Cambodia face a tariff of 36 percent on their goods in the US, their biggest export market, unless a reduction can be negotiated.

After the ceasefire deal was reached, Trump said he had spoken to both leaders and instructed his trade team to restart tariff talks.

On Wednesday, Thailand said Cambodian forces fired on positions in northeastern Thailand's Sisaket province on Cambodia's northern border.

""Cambodian forces used small arms and grenade launchers, prompting Thailand to respond in self-defence,"" Thai army spokesman Major-General Winthai Suvaree told reporters.

""This was the second incident since the agreement and reflects a behaviour that does not respect agreements, destroys de-escalation efforts and hampers trust between the two countries.""

Cambodia rejected the allegations, saying it was committed to the ceasefire and called for observers.

""Cambodia strongly rejects the ceasefire accusations as false, misleading and harmful to the fragile trust-building process,"" Cambodian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Chum Sounry told reporters at a press conference, adding the government supports a monitoring mechanism and independent observation.

The ceasefire, which also agreed to halt troop movement, paves the way for a high-level military meeting that includes defence ministers on August 4 in Cambodia.

There have been no reports of any exchange of heavy artillery fire but also no reports of troop withdrawals by either side."

Reports cited an unnamed source on Tuesday as saying that no decision has been made yet, but Prime Minister Mark Carney is expected to hold a virtual cabinet meeting on Wednesday to discuss the situation in the Middle East.

The reports came shortly after Carney spoke with his British counterpart, Keir Starmer, about the situation in besieged Gaza and the UK's statement on the recognition of Palestine.

On Monday, Canada's Foreign Minister Anita Anand reaffirmed Ottawa's commitment to a two-state solution.

""Despite the complexity of the situation, our collective presence here today reflects strong international support for a negotiated solution, one that ensures Palestinian self-determination and Israeli security,"" Anand said.

Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron said Paris would recognise Palestine during the UN General Assembly in September.

This week, Starmer followed suit and said his government would also recognise Palestine at the UNGA if Israel fails to take steps to end its carnage in Gaza.

Israel slammed the move by the UK, saying it would be a ""reward for Hamas.""

Palestine is currently recognised by 149 of the UN’s 193 member states — a number that has grown since Israel launched its genocide in Gaza in October 2023."
7/29/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/01cf68001c0a,,"China on Monday rolled out an annual childcare subsidy of 3,600 yuan ($502) until age three, as authorities look to spur a flagging birth rate.

Authorities are concerned that fewer young people are choosing to have children, and the number of elderly people is increasing.

The high cost of childcare and education, as well as job uncertainty and a slowing economy, are among the concerns that have discouraged many young Chinese from getting married and starting a family.

Subsidies will start retroactively from the start of this year, with partial subsidies for those younger than three who were born prior to 2025, in a policy expected to benefit more than 20 million families of toddlers and infants, the official Xinhua news agency said.

The plan was an ""important national livelihood policy"", and direct cash subsidies would help ""reduce the cost of family childbirth and parenting,"" the National Health Commission said.

As of the end of 2024, China had 310 million people aged 60 and above. China’s total population is around 1.41 billion, based on Worldometer’s elaboration of the latest United Nations data.

China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, with experts warning of a worsening downturn, after decades of falling birth rates following a one-child policy adopted from 1980 to 2015, coupled with rapid urbanisation.

In the past two years, provinces nationwide have started handing out childcare subsidies in amounts that vary considerably, from 1,000 yuan ($139) a child to up to 100,000 yuan ($13,931), including housing subsidies.

The central government will fund the new national policy instead of local authorities, Xinhua said.

Raising children in the country is among the costliest globally when measured against income levels, according to a Chinese study.

Authorities rolled out a series of ""fertility-friendly"" measures in 2024 to tackle the coming decade's expected challenge of the entry into retirement of roughly 300 million people, equivalent to almost the entire US population."
7/29/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/b0995e2850ed,,"The administration of United States President Donald Trump has issued a new memo allowing federal employees to openly promote their religious beliefs at work.

Released on July 28 by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the US government’s human resource agency, the memo outlines a broad set of protections aimed at reinforcing “religious freedom” across the federal workforce.

Agency employees may seek to ""persuade others of the correctness of their own religious views"" in the office, Scott Kupor, director of the OPM, wrote in a statement, cited by Reuters.

Supervisors can attempt to invite their employees to their religion, so long as the efforts aren’t “harassing in nature,” according to the statement. Agencies can't discipline their employees for declining to talk to their coworkers about their religious views.

“During a break, an employee may engage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs. However, if the nonadherent requests such attempts to stop, the employee should honour the request,” the memo added.

“An employee may invite another to worship at her church despite being belonging to a different faith.”

As per the five-page memo, federal employees are now permitted to: display religious symbols, such as Bibles, crosses, or prayer beads, at their workspaces, join or organise prayer groups during non-duty hours, discuss or share their faith with colleagues, including efforts to persuade and request religious accommodations, including telework or flexible hours, particularly for religious observances.

The memo emphasises that supervisors may also express religious beliefs, provided they do not coerce employees or imply official endorsement.

It builds on longstanding protections in US law, including the First Amendment and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits religious discrimination.

The memo represents the latest effort to expand the role of religion in the federal workplace.

“Federal employees should never have to choose between their faith and their career,” Kupor said in a press statement.

OPM in mid-July said agency workers can get permission to work from home or adjust their hours to accommodate religious prayers, after previously demanding that workers report to offices full-time.

Supporters say the policy strengthens freedom of religion in the public sector. Critics argue it could encourage proselytising and compromise the separation of religion and government in official workplaces.

This latest move is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to elevate religious expression in public institutions, following the creation of a White House Faith Office and other initiatives focused on combating what it calls “anti-religious bias” in government.

A large part of evangelical Christians voted for Trump."
7/28/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/5bc24073797c,,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has taken a swipe at European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, claiming that US President Donald Trump had outmanoeuvred her in recent EU-US trade discussions.

“Trump ate von der Leyen for breakfast,” Orban said on Monday, using sharp language to characterise what he described as a one-sided outcome in Washington’s favour.

The comment followed the announcement of a trade framework between the European Union and the United States, which Orban criticised as overly favourable to US interests.

He added that the outcome fell short compared to a similar deal Washington recently reached with the UK.

The agreement, announced on Sunday, will see the US impose a 15 percent import tariff on most EU goods, half of the threatened rate of 30 percent.

The bloc will also invest $600 billion in the US and purchase $750 billion in American energy and military equipment.

“It was not a deal that President Donald Trump made with Ursula von der Leyen. The US president is a heavyweight negotiator, and the Madame President is a featherweight.”

Orban said. “The American agreement with the UK is much better than this. The European agreement is worse than the English one. Therefore, it will be difficult to claim it as a success later on.”

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto echoed Orban’s criticism, saying the developments underscored the need for new leadership in Brussels.

The Hungarian leader, who has long aligned himself with Trump and often clashes with EU leadership, made the remarks during a domestic political event, where he also reiterated his opposition to deeper EU integration and what he called the Commission’s “submissive diplomacy.”

Neither the European Commission nor the Trump administration has responded publicly to Orban’s remarks.

Von der Leyen has not commented directly on the trade talks or Orban’s criticisms, though her office previously defended the negotiations as part of efforts to strengthen transatlantic economic ties.

The EU and US have been working to stabilise their trade relationship after years of friction under the Trump administration, including disputes over tariffs and subsidies.

Orban’s comments suggest that Trump’s return to the global stage, even unofficially, is already reshaping European political rhetoric."
7/28/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/114c2add2514,,"Washington, DC, — The numbers say it plainly: the Democratic Party is in trouble.

It’s been six months since Donald Trump returned to the White House, sweeping all seven battleground states and dragging the House and Senate back under Republican control. And though President Trump's ratings are currently underwater, Democrats have yet to find their footing, let alone mount a compelling challenge.

A recent CNN poll released earlier this month found only 28 percent of Americans view the Democratic Party favourably — the lowest rating recorded by the outlet since it began polling the question in 1992. A new Wall Street Journal poll on July 25 delivered a further blow: 63 percent of voters now hold an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party, the highest in Journal polling going back to 1990.

Asking voters how they would vote in the midterms if they were held today, the Journal found Democrats leading Republicans by 3 points — 46 to 43 percent.

Voters aren't exactly warming to the GOP either, but that's little comfort.

The Republican Party's net favourability, though negative, is less dire than the Democrats'.

Even Trump himself is viewed more favourably than the party trying to unseat him.

The problem runs deeper than bad press or scattered strategy. According to Democratic pollster John Anzalone, ""The Democratic brand is so bad that they don't have the credibility to be a critic of Trump or the Republican Party.""That credibility gap is now a chasm: one made worse by confusion within the party’s ranks. There is no unifying voice, no compelling narrative, and no consistent answer to what Democrats stand for. Scott Tranter, Director of data science at Decision Desk HQ, puts it plainly: ""It’s pretty clear that Schumer is not the guy, just based on his approval rating.""

""Out of touch and weak""Even Democrats' recent wins in local and state elections haven't translated into a national resurgence. Instead, voters are labelling them with bruising words like out of touch and weak. That's how they showed up in a recent internal poll by Democratic super PAC Unite the Country: a brutal self-assessment from within the trenches.

The party has seen its support erode with white men, Hispanic men, and working-class voters across the board.

Experts say that Democrats need to show that they're hearing people's concerns and actively offering solutions to those concerns to make their lives better and more affordable, but that is not happening.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and fellow Democrats outside the US Capitol.

An AP-NORC poll found that only a third of Democrats feel optimistic about their party’s future, a sharp drop from 57 percent this time last year.

Meanwhile, more voters are now identifying as Republicans than Democrats, and the GOP holds a growing financial edge.

The erosion of Democratic trust isn't new. It's a slow bleed: decades of missed moments, muddled messages, and competing factions inside the party. But under Trump 2.0, the urgency has returned. And still, many Democrats are fumbling for a megaphone.

This week, as the House began its summer recess, Democrats fanned out across the country to host town halls, some in Republican districts, hoping to stir the kind of backlash energy that lit up Trump’s first term. Their aim: to call out Trump’s agenda and style of governance. But with no standout messenger and no cohesive story, it's not clear whether voters are tuning in.

""No single leader or single messenger""

Stephen Farnsworth, Professor of Political Science and Director at the University of Mary Washington’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies, told TRT World that the GOP has simply won the messaging war. ""Republicans have been much better at painting the Democrats as out of touch than the reverse.""

It's not just what's said, he argues. It's where and how it's said. ""Democrats have no comparable television and online platform to compete with Fox News,"" Farnsworth noted.

""And they have no single leader or single messenger to compete with the president for shaping the narrative. That's the nature of being out of power at the White House and in Congress.""

Even on issues where Democrats might expect traction, such as Trump’s past associations with Jeffrey Epstein — Farnsworth says Republicans are seizing the mic first.

""Even Trump’s current problems with the Epstein files have as much to do with Republican efforts as Democratic messages.""

Interestingly, midterms (taking place next year) have traditionally punished the party in power, a pattern that, on paper, should favour the Democrats.

McInturff, a Republican pollster, notes that five successive presidents have lost control of Congress, including former President Barack Obama, whose party lost 63 seats in the Tea Party surge in the first election after he took office.

With their approval numbers sinking and their message unclear, Democrats can at least take some comfort in this: the midterms have a habit of humbling the party in power. And that rule hasn't broken yet."

Trump said on Monday that he was reducing the 50-day deadline he gave Russia over its war in Ukraine, underscoring his frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin for prolonging the fighting between the two countries.

""I'm going to reduce the 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number because I think I already know the answer to what's going to happen,"" Trump said, speaking alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer ahead of their meeting in Scotland.

Trump set the 50-day deadline earlier this month. The US president has repeatedly voiced exasperation with Putin for continuing attacks on Ukraine despite US efforts to end the war.

Before returning to the White House in January, Trump, who views himself as a peacemaker, had promised to end the three-and-a-half-year-old conflict within 24 hours.

Trump has threatened new sanctions on Russia and buyers of its exports unless an agreement is reached by early September.

But the president, who has also expressed annoyance with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has not always followed up on his tough talk about Putin with action, citing what he deems a good relationship that the two men have had previously.

""We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kiev and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever,"" Trump said. ""And I say that's not the way to do it."""
7/28/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/f47ccb6ccf14,"Exit bans, corporate curbs, and espionage fears: China-US tensions escalate ahead of trade talksThe twin developments — China barring two Americans from leaving and a Chinese-American engineer pleading guilty to spying in the US — come just as Washington and Beijing restart trade talks in Sweden.","Two American nationals—a US government employee and a senior banker—have been barred from leaving China in recent weeks, marking a sharp escalation in the use of Beijing’s “exit bans” even as the two sides prepare to start a fresh round of trade talks in Sweden on Monday.

The moves come amid lingering geopolitical rivalry between the US and China and have prompted corporate travel restrictions and renewed warnings about the risks faced by American citizens operating in China.

The bans coincided with revelations that a US-based engineer with dual Chinese and American citizenship pleaded guilty to stealing sensitive military technologies for China, further fueling speculation over potential tit-for-tat measures.

While some observers suggest the cases may be linked, analysts cautioned against drawing premature conclusions.

“From China’s perspective, there is no shift in policy, but rather a consistent application of legal standards,” Einar Tangen, senior fellow at the Beijing-based Taihe Institute, told TRT World. He said the exit bans are viewed in Beijing as “individual judicial matters.”

Rorry Daniels, Managing Director at Asia Society Policy Institute, described the trend as part of a “disturbing climate of mutual mistrust”. At the same time, James Zimmerman, a lawyer in Beijing and former chairman of American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham China), noted that the legal tool has existed since the 1980s.

Two Americans blocked from leaving China

The US State Department confirmed on July 22 that a US Patent and Trademark Office employee has been barred from leaving China for over three months. The man, also a US Army veteran, reportedly failed to declare his government affiliation on a visa application.

According to The New York Times, the employee travelled to Chengdu, the capital city of China’s southwestern Sichuan province, in April to visit family but was intercepted by Ministry of State Security (MSS) officers. The report stated that the MSS officers seized his passport, credit card, and personal devices and interrogated him about his military service maintaining Black Hawk helicopters. Although his passport was later returned, he has been barred from leaving.

Shortly before, Mao Chenyue, a Shanghai-born US citizen and Wells Fargo managing director, was placed under an exit ban while on a business trip to China. She has been unable to return to the US, and Wells Fargo has since suspended all employee travel to China.

China’s Foreign Ministry confirmed Mao’s travel restriction, saying it was part of a “criminal investigation,” but declined to provide details. “Everyone in China, whether Chinese or foreign, must abide by Chinese laws,” said spokesperson Guo Jiakun.

Legal tool or political leverage?

Chinese authorities argue that exit bans are lawful tools used to support investigations, prevent flight risks, and uphold national security.

“Exit bans are commonly used in investigations to prevent witnesses or suspects viewed as flight risks from exiting mainland China,” Zimmerman told TRT World.

“Most of the time, there is a legitimate legal basis, but there are indeed instances of misuse, including for political reasons,” he noted.

Tangen, on the other hand, asserted that “China upholds the rule of law and handles entry and exit affairs in accordance with legal procedures,” adding that similar practices exist in the US, EU, and UK.

“Chinese nationals have faced prosecution abroad for offences ranging from money laundering to cyber espionage. Legal accountability crosses borders.”

Zimmerman acknowledged the legal framework but pointed to concerns over a lack of transparency and “the absence of a workable bail system” that makes lifting an exit ban difficult.

He also highlighted the rising use of exit bans by China’s Central Commission on Disciplinary Inspection (CCDI) in corruption probes, including those involving foreign-linked firms or executives with past connections to Chinese government officials or state-owned enterprises.

Daniels, meanwhile, emphasised the ambiguity around how individuals become targets. “Americans doing business in China are now being caught in the crossfire and subject to China’s extremely opaque legal system,” she warned. “Without real due process, there is always an open question that detentions of Americans in China are state-directed to build leverage with the US government.”

“It’s difficult to build a good risk mitigation strategy because it’s not clear how one becomes a target for an exit ban,” she said. “More transparency would help prevent a chilling effect on business travel.”

Espionage case fuels speculation

The exit bans came just as Chinese-American engineer Chenguang Gong pleaded guilty in California to stealing over 3,600 sensitive files intended for military use, according to a Justice Department statement released on July 21.

US authorities said Gong had ties to Chinese “talent programs” and proposed developing military-grade infrared and radar technology for Beijing.

While some observers speculate a retaliatory link between Gong’s case and China’s recent imposition of exit bans on two Americans, both Tangen and Zimmerman cautioned against drawing conclusions.

“Beijing would likely reject any suggestion that these cases are linked,” said Tangen.

However, Tangen also cited past cases such as that of Canada’s ‘Two Michaels’—Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig—who were arrested in China on espionage charges in 2018 and later released in 2021, following Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou freed by Canada in what was dubbed as “hostage diplomacy.”

“The blanket denials from the Canadian government eventually turned out to be false. It later emerged one was an asset and the other his handler,” he said.

“To put things in perspective,” he added, “the US, via CIA, and British security services MI5 and MI6 have openly advertised for Mandarin-speaking spies over the internet. If there is a question of spying, Beijing will react as Washington or any other jurisdiction.”

Corporate fallout: Travel warnings and device restrictions

The latest exit bans have sent shockwaves through the US corporate sector. On July 22, American multinational investment firm BlackRock issued internal guidelines banning staff from using company laptops and remote networks while in China, urging the use of burner phones.

Later, the firm reportedly suspended all trips to China.

Wells Fargo and other major US companies have followed suit.

Zimmerman said tech restrictions have existed for years to protect commercial secrets, but “exit bans on executives are a red line. “Foreign business recognises that its executives must abide by local laws and regulations but also don’t want to get caught up in a hostage diplomacy situation,” he noted.

“At the same time, the Chinese government understands detaining executives is a red line and is cautious about ensuring that any exit bans imposed on executives have a legal basis,” added Zimmerman.

Tangen stressed that China is trying to avoid alienating investors. “Beijing is committed to legal due process,” he said, citing visa-free access for 47 countries, improved IP protections, and the 2025 Action Plan to stabilise foreign investment.

Impact on Trump’s trade war

The recent exit bans come against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s ongoing trade war with China, prompting questions about their possible impact on future diplomatic and trade negotiations as the two sides meet in Sweden for a fresh round of trade talks on Monday.

The current 90-day truce between the US and China—which saw the two countries temporarily lowering tariffs on each other—is set to end on August 12.

While the timing—coinciding with Trump’s push for a China visit and ahead of the tariffs deadline—has raised eyebrows, “any political linkage would be speculative,” cautioned Tangen.

Zimmerman, while cautious about linking the exit bans to trade war, however, pointed out that “the Chinese side has its own leverage points against Trump’s tariffs, including outbound restrictions on rare earth metals.”

Still, Daniels noted that “the Trump administration has a very high regard for the safety of US citizens, including those travelling abroad, and would certainly raise these cases as concerns.”"

The High Election Committee met on Saturday with President Ahmad al Sharaa to brief him on key amendments to the temporary electoral law, following rounds of consultations with various sectors of Syrian society, the committee's head, Mohammad Taha al Ahmad, said in comments carried by the state news agency SANA.

Al Sharaa stressed the importance of conducting the elections across all Syrian provinces and rejected any notion of territorial division, which all Syrians oppose.

The Syrian president also emphasised the need to exclude individuals who supported or collaborated with war criminals, as well as those who promote sectarianism or partition, al Ahmad added.

The number of seats in the People's Assembly (parliament) will increase from 150 to 210 under the revised system. Based on the 2011 population census, seat allocations across provinces will expand accordingly. The president will appoint 70 of the 210 members, al Ahmad said.

He explained that after a presidential decree on the temporary electoral system is signed, the election committee will need about a week to form subcommittees, which will then have 15 days to select the electoral bodies.

Candidate registration will follow, giving nominees a week to prepare their campaigns, which will include debates with electoral bodies and committee members.

The polls are expected to take place between September 15 and 20, he confirmed, adding that women will make up at least 20 percent of the electoral bodies.

He also stated that the electoral process will be open to observation by civil society and international organisations, under the supervision of the High Election Committee, which will also ensure the right to challenge candidate lists and final results.

On Saturday evening, the Syrian presidency confirmed receipt of the final version of the temporary electoral law for the parliament.

On June 13, al Sharaa issued a decree establishing the High Election Committee, initially setting the number of parliamentary seats at 150 before expanding it to 210.

According to the decree, the committee is tasked with forming electoral bodies, which will elect two-thirds of the parliament. The remaining one-third will be appointed by the president.

Seats will be distributed across provinces based on population and categorised into constituencies for community leaders and intellectuals, in accordance with criteria set by the committee."

""Our teams have been here in Washington... a committee has been tasked by the Prime Minister to fine-tune now. It’s not going to be months, not even weeks—just days.""

His remarks came just hours after meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the State Department, where the two discussed bilateral and regional issues, including strengthening bilateral trade and enhancing collaboration in the critical minerals and mining sectors.

Dar said the agreement would include cooperation on trade and minerals, and he invited US entrepreneurs to invest in Pakistan’s vast resources, particularly in mining and offshore gas.

He also said institutions like the US Export-Import Bank and the World Bank are ready to support American investors.

""There is great potential,"" he added, noting Pakistan’s natural resources are valued at $6–8 trillion.US President Donald Trump hosted Pakistan's army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an unprecedented meeting that risked worsening a disagreement with India over the president's statement that he had stopped a conflict between the nuclear-armed South Asian foes in May this year.

“Yesterday, I had a phone conversation with the acting Prime Minister of Thailand and the Prime Minister of Cambodia, because of Malaysia’s position and their respect for us,"" said Anwar on Friday.

He added that both countries needed “some time” to organise a troop withdrawal as part of a proposed ceasefire.

Thailand's acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai has blamed Cambodia for initiating the latest armed conflict by using ""military force first,"" while imposing martial law in border provinces.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, meanwhile, said he made it clear to Anwar that Cambodia agreed with his proposal for a ceasefire, but Thailand reversed its initial support for the truce.

""Thai side had agreed to his proposal for a ceasefire, setting midnight on 24 July 2025 as the time for both sides to cease the fighting,"" Hun Manet said on Facebook.

But, he added, ""it is regrettable that just over an hour later, the Thai side informed that they had reversed their position from agreeing to the ceasefire at midnight on 24 July 2025, to not agreeing and waiting for a later date.""

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has called for restraint and reaffirmed Malaysia's role as a regional mediator as armed clashes between Thailand and Cambodia continued for a second straight day along their shared border.

The recent flare-up has heightened tensions in the region. Thailand’s acting leader, Phumtham, accused Cambodia of sparking the conflict by initiating military aggression and subsequently imposed martial law in border provinces.

7/25/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/0d353ab47008,"What's Trump’s AI action plan and how it tries to put US on top amid China rivalryThe new US artificial intelligence blueprint targets China, but as the race heats up, questions remain over whether cutting “red tape” can keep America ahead.","President Donald Trump has announced a broad plan to secure America’s “global dominance” in artificial intelligence, aiming to preserve the country’s edge over China in this fast-developing sector.

The proposal includes loosening environmental rules to accelerate AI supercomputer projects and boost sales of US-made technology both domestically and overseas.

The 28-page policy framework titled “Winning the Race: America’s AI Action Plan,” outlines more than 90 policy actions for the fast-developing technology that administration officials say can be implemented over the next year.

""We believe we're in an AI race, and we want the United States to win that race,"" said David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar, during a press briefing.

The government pledges to boost US innovation while stripping away what it calls ""bureaucratic red tape"" and ""ideological bias"".

“America must once again be a country where innovators are rewarded with a green light, not strangled with red tape,” Trump said at an unveiling event that was co-hosted by the bipartisan Hill and Valley Forum and the ‘All-In’ podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four tech investors and David Sacks.

The new blueprint calls for the export of US AI software and hardware abroad as well as a crackdown on state laws deemed too restrictive to let it flourish, a marked departure from predecessor Joe Biden's ""high fence"" approach that limited global access to coveted AI chips.

""We also have to have a single federal standard, not 50 different states regulating this industry in the future,"" Trump said.

To push the agenda forward, the plan instructs the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy to gather input on federal rules seen as obstacles to AI innovation and uptake.

It also tasks the Office of Management and Budget with identifying and repealing regulations that are said to delay AI development or rollout. Under the new policy, federal agencies will withhold AI-related discretionary funding from states that enforce ""burdensome AI regulations.""

The Federal Communication Commission is told to examine which state-level AI rules may interfere with its authority, while the Federal Trade Commission is ordered to reassess Biden-era investigations to ensure they do not rely on legal interpretations that place unnecessary restrictions on AI innovation.

The document further states that federal contracts will be awarded only to developers of large language models that are “objective and free from top-down ideological bias.”

Senior White House officials confirmed that the General Services Administration will revise contracting language to reflect this standard, prioritising AI systems focused on “truth seeking” over those regarded as socially programmed.

“We're updating federal procurement guidelines allowing the government to only contract with LLM developers who ensure that their systems allow free speech and expression to flourish,” said Michael Kratsios, OSTP director, during a press briefing, highlighting diversity, equity and inclusion mandates in large language models as a primary concern.

President Donald Trump marked the plan's release with a speech where he laid out the stakes of the technological arms race with China, calling it a fight that will define the 21st century.

""America is the country that started the AI race. And as President of the United States, I'm here today to declare that America is going to win it,"" he said.

In April, Trump blocked the export of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China but allowed the company to resume sales earlier this month, sparking rare public criticism from fellow Republicans.

""If we're regulating ourselves to death and allowing the Chinese to catch up to us, that's not something ... we should blame the Chinese for..., that is something we should blame our own leaders for, for having stupid policies that allow other countries to catch up with America,"" Vice President JD Vance said.

The plan also reflects concerns about America’s outdated energy infrastructure in the face of rising AI demands.

""AI is the first digital service in modern life that challenges America to build vastly greater energy generation than we have today. American energy capacity has stagnated since the 1970s while China has rapidly built out their grid,” it states.

Many industry experts involved in the plan have also acknowledged China’s influence and rivalry in AI, while expressing support for the new framework.

“China has had a national plan for global AI leadership since 2017, and is executing it relentlessly with talent, infrastructure, state-backed investment, and international influence,” said American Edge Project CEO Doug Kelly.

Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan also stated that the Silicon Valley-based company is proud to be investing hundreds of billions of dollars in job-creating infrastructure across the US.

“We’re in the middle of a fierce competition with China for AI leadership. The White House’s AI Action Plan is a bold step to create the right regulatory environment for companies like ours to invest in America.”

However, some experts argue that the plan falls short in several key areas.

“The Trump administration has reversed its ban on sales of a sophisticated American chip (Nvidia’s “H20”) to China, which will power China’s models,” says Rush Doshi, Director of the China Strategy Initiative at the Council on Foreign Relations.

He states the plan still does not make clear whether Washington is pursuing a consistent and restrictive export policy or simply responding to commercial pressures as they arise. From Beijing’s perspective, this uncertainty could easily be read as a strategic opening.

And then there’s the question of scale. China’s progress in artificial intelligence does not only come from the result of access to advanced chips. It is also the product of coordinated state-led investment, rapid infrastructure expansion, and a growing international presence.

Jonathan Hillman, a Senior Fellow for Geoeconomics, noted that China’s Digital Silk Road continues to gain ground across emerging markets by offering software and chips that also complete AI systems, including training and financing.

While the Trump plan includes a proposal to promote the export of American AI systems, experts warn that the effort may be undermined by excessive bureaucracy and the absence of a clear geographical strategy.

Another Senior Fellow for International Economics, Sebastian Mallaby, Paul A. pointed out that the plan’s endorsement of open-source models may carry unintended consequences. Although these models broaden access to AI tools, they also raise significant security concerns.

“Bad actors might use these models for bad ends, from the mass production of deep fakes to the building of weapons,” he wrote."

""We're taking a look, and it looks like it's about $3.1 billion. It went up a little bit or a lot. So the $2.7 (billion) is now $3.1 (billion),"" Trump said on Thursday as Powell visibly shook his head in apparent rejection of the president's claim.

""I'm not aware of that,"" retorted Powell, suggesting that the total renovation cost Trump marched out before reporters includes the renovation of the Federal Reserve's William McChesney Martin Jr. Building, which was completed in 2021, in addition to the two buildings that are currently in the midst of construction.

""You just added in a third building. That's what that is. That's a third building,"" said Powell.

""Well, I know, but it's a building being built,"" Trump said.

""No. It was built five years ago. We finished Martin five years ago,"" the Fed chairman retorted.

Currently, the Fed's Marriner S. Eccles and 1951 Constitution Avenue buildings are under renovation. Both were built in the 1930s, and while Powell has acknowledged cost overruns that have been incurred in the course of renovating the nearly 100-year-old facilities, he has maintained they were in dire need of updating, prompting the Board to approve the overhaul in 2017.

""Both buildings were in need of significant structural repairs and other updates to make the buildings safe, healthy, and effective places to work, including the removal of asbestos and lead contamination, complete replacement of antiquated systems such as electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation, as well as fire detection and suppression systems,"" Powell wrote in a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought last week.

Construction on the Eccles and 1951 Constitution Avenue buildings is expected to be completed in 2027.

Trump and his political allies have sought to use the associated cost overruns as barbs against Powell as the chairman has so far refused to comport to the president's demands to lower interest rates over fears that doing so will exacerbate inflation at a time when the economic toll of Trump's tariff war remains unknown.

Powell has kept the key short-term rate at 4.3% after he instituted three cuts in 2024."

The violence on Thursday, the deadliest in years, prompted regional and international concern, though both governments have signalled openness to dialogue.

While the origins of Thursday’s flare-up remain contested, with both sides accusing the other of initiating fire, officials later stated that the situation along the border had “calmed down” by the evening.

Efforts to mediate are already underway.

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who currently chairs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), spoke with both leaders and urged an “immediate ceasefire.”

He welcomed what he called “positive signals” from both Bangkok and Phnom Penh and offered Malaysia’s help in facilitating talks.

The Thai Health Ministry confirmed that the dead included a child and a soldier.

Among the 31 wounded were seven soldiers.

Cambodia has not officially reported casualties, but Thai officials accused Cambodian rockets of striking multiple civilian areas, while Cambodian media alleged Thai F-16 fighter jets damaged the UNESCO-listed Preah Vihear Temple.

Amid the escalating conflict, both countries closed schools and reported displacements of civilians on either side of the border.

Cambodian military officials claimed to have retained control over key border landmarks, including the Ta Moan Thom and Ta Krabey temples, as well as the Mom Tei area.

Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet condemned what he described as “premeditated military aggression” by Thailand and urged the UN Security Council to intervene.

“We have no choice but to respond with military force,” he said, while maintaining Cambodia’s commitment to peaceful conflict resolution.

Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said his country had not declared war and emphasised the need to halt fighting before entering any negotiations. “What is happening is just armed clashes,” he told reporters, calling for calm and dialogue."

This will allow Israel direct access to the YPG-held region in northeastern Syria.,"Israel’s dangerous military intervention in southern Syria has put the spotlight back on the Zionist state’s controversial David’s Corridor project, which threatens the territorial integrity of the war-ravaged country amid rising tensions across the volatile Middle East.

Southern Syria’s Sweida region witnessed ethnic clashes between Druze, an ethno-religious Arabic-speaking minority, which is an offshoot of Shia Islam, and Sunni Bedouin tribes, leaving hundreds of people dead and injured.

Sweida is the only Druze-majority area in Syria where Sunni Arabs constitute the majority.

Amid growing tensions in the region, Türkiye has vowed to intervene to prevent further bifurcation of Syria – in what is being seen as a tough message to Israel’s expansionist policies.

The so-called David’s Corridor project is part of Israel’s bigger plans in the region.

As per plans, the corridor will allow Israel unimpeded passage from the occupied Golan Heights to Sweida and as far as the US base of Al-Tanf and Deir Ezzor, a region under the control of the US-backed SDF/YPG terror group in northeastern Syria.

Israel envisions that the corridor can even reach Iraq’s autonomous northern Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), which neighbours both Türkiye and Iran.

“This David’s Corridor project is an attempt by Israel to establish its hegemony over the Middle East,” says Sami al Arian, a leading Palestinian academic and the director of the Center for Islam and Global Affairs at Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University.

“This is a dream they have been trying to attain ever since the Zionist project started with Theodor Herzl and particularly since the 1967 war,” Arian tells TRT World, referring to two critical milestones in Israel’s history.

Theodor Herzl, an Austrian-Hungarian journalist, is the founder of the Zionist movement in the late 1890s.

The 1967 war, or the Six-Day War, was a significant Israeli victory over four Arab states, which allowed Tel Aviv to illegally occupy the West Bank, Gaza and Syria’s Golan Heights, which has a significant Druze population.

Experts also see a conceptual connection between the David’s Corridor and Greater Israel, a biblical concept of ancient Israel that stretches from the Nile River to the Euphrates.

The idea of Biblical Israel has been publicly embraced by Netanyahu’s extremist coalition partners and often used as a justification for Tel Aviv’s expansionist policies.

A divide and rule strategy

According to Arian, the David’s Corridor is an attempt to link the illegally occupied Golan Heights with the Iraqi Kurdish region through southern Syria.

By instrumentalising the corridor and through other political and military means, Israelis want to partition and divide Syria into Sunni Arab, Alawite, Kurdish and Druze groups across the country.

By forming alliances with minorities like the Druze in Syria and Maronites, a Christian Lebanese population which aligned with Israel in the past, the Zionist state aims to exploit the ethnic and religious faultlines to fragment the Middle East into as many parts as possible, says Arian.

But he describes this Israeli agenda as a pipedream, which can not succeed.

In the name of supporting the Druze, who also have a significant presence in Israel – including some top generals in the country’s army – the Netanyahu government not only bombed Bedouin tribes around Sweida but also the central government’s defence ministry in Damascus.

Netanyahu also declared southern Syria a demilitarised zone, in clear signs that Tel Aviv is proclaiming control over the area to gain access to the US Al-Tanf base from which it can connect with Deir Ezzor, which is under the US-backed YPG terror group operating under the SDF banner.

Under international pressure, Israel and Syria reached a fragile ceasefire in Sweida as central government forces withdrew from the region, leaving the area under de facto control of the Druze.

Amid growing regional tensions, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan accused Israel of planning to fragment Syria and threatened to intervene to protect the country’s integrity.

While Fidan did not directly address the so-called David’s Corridor, it has long been a growing concern in Ankara.

Omar Alhariri, a Daraa-based Syrian journalist who lived through the brutal civil war, the regime change in Damascus and the Israeli strikes, has a thinking similar to Fidan.

“Israel’s actions clearly reflect a consistent strategy aimed at fostering internal chaos and preventing the emergence of a stable and prosperous Syrian state,” Alhariri tells TRT World.

“Israel’s behaviour towards Syria amounts to outright bullying, emboldened by the international community’s silence regarding its actions in Gaza.”

Daraa, Alhariri’s hometown, was the cradle of the anti-Assad opposition at the beginning of the civil war in 2011 and now the target of Israeli strikes because it lies directly in the path of the David’s Corridor.

Israelis now have a presence in the far west of Daraa and in the Yarmouk area on the border between Syria, the Golan Heights and Jordan.

“As for David’s Corridor, publicly available maps suggest a potential severing of the Syrian-Jordanian border, (which could be) an extremely dangerous development that threatens the sovereignty and stability of both nations,” says the Daraa-based analyst, referring to Jordan and Syria.

Israel, a Zionist state based on secularist Jewish nationalism, has long been attempting to weaken and destabilise the Arab states as part of its statecraft.

Previously, Israel’s rightwing Defence Minister Israel Katz advocated “a federal Syria that includes different autonomous regions”, seen as a euphemism for a weakened state.

US envoy to Syria Tom Barrack recently confirmed this view, saying that the Netanyahu government aims to fragment the war-torn country because strong nation-states do not align with Israeli interests.

“Israel is also using this corridor to project the narrative that its movement through Sweida or eastern Syria is motivated by a desire to protect minorities or that it enjoys local support. These claims are false and deliberately aimed at sowing division among Syrians—divisions that ultimately serve Israel’s strategic interests,” says Alhariri.

“This particular narrative is especially dangerous—as recent events in Sweida have clearly demonstrated—because it exploits identity and community sensitivities to serve Israel’s strategic aims.”

Will Israel attack Daraa?

Alhariri believes that an Israeli ground attack on Daraa, a densely populated area and home to over one and a half million people, will meet “a prolonged and determined resistance”.

He underlines the region’s strong tribal and social ties with neighbouring Jordan, which means that any Israeli attempt to occupy this area would risk igniting a broader regional conflict.

“If such an Israeli attack happens, it would lead to a long and violent war that could last for years, spreading across the whole region. Israel is not ready to deal with something that serious.”

An Israeli occupation of southern Syria would also mean cutting the Arab state off from Jordan and the Gulf, breaking the land route between Türkiye and the Gulf countries, according to Alhariri.

“This would have serious consequences far beyond Syria,” he adds."
7/24/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/036a8fa67dfc,Why China’s mega dam project is raising alarms in IndiaBeijing’s mega-dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet stirs geopolitical tensions and environmental anxiety in India and Bangladesh.,"China has begun construction of what is set to become the world’s largest hydropower dam in Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon located in the Tibetan Plateau.

The project has sparked concerns in downstream neighbours India and Bangladesh about the hazards of flooding, water scarcity and environmental degradation.

On July 19, Chinese Premier Li Qiang presided over a high-profile ceremony marking the official start of construction of the Motuo Hydropower Station—a massive $167 billion project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River.

Once completed, the dam is expected to generate three times the electricity of the Three Gorges Dam, making it the largest of its kind in the world.

A civil infrastructure of this size has never been attempted. Especially in a remote mountainous region, which sits right on top of an active seismic belt.

The Yarlung Tsangpo River transforms into the Brahmaputra as it flows downstream into northeast India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states, before entering Bangladesh, where it is known as the Jamuna.

Why is it significant

While Beijing touts the project as a green energy breakthrough, authorities in India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states are raising alarm over potential catastrophic effects downstream.

Arunachal’s Chief Minister Pema Khandu warned that the dam could lead to the drying up of the Siang and Brahmaputra rivers, or worse, function as a ""water bomb"" if China were to release water suddenly.

Similar concerns have also been expressed by Bangladeshi officials, who earlier in February this year sent a formal request to Beijing for more information on the project’s environmental impact assessment and feasibility study.

The Brahmaputra basin—stretching across India’s Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, and into Bangladesh—is one of the most flood-prone regions in the world, with seasonal deluges causing widespread devastation and thousands of deaths nearly every year.

In Assam, the Brahmaputra River is not just a lifeline but the primary source of irrigation, sustaining the state’s agrarian economy. Fears that China’s newly launched mega-dam upstream could alter the natural flow or trigger sudden water discharges have intensified concerns about the impact on the region.

Further fuelling concerns are environmental and seismic risks. The Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon is located in a high-altitude, earthquake-prone zone, raising fears about the potential for dam collapse or structural failure.

It’s interesting to note that the Indian and Bangladeshi governments have not yet officially commented on the project since work started on it.

China hasn’t officially shared details about the design. It’s unclear if this would be a massive run-of-the-river project that involves multiple small dams and power plants or if long tunnels would be dug through the Namcha Barwa mountain to force water from higher to lower regions to generate electricity.

Yarlung Tsangpo flows through what is said to be the world’s deepest and longest land canyon. The project will be built in a region where the river falls 2,000 meters within a short stretch of 50 kilometres, making it an ideal site for power production.

Beijing hasn’t indicated that it wants to use the project for agricultural purposes. This point is important. Generally, lower riparian countries fear that water will be blocked, badly affecting the farm output.

While the Yarlung Tsangpo originates in China, most of the water it eventually discharges—as it becomes the Brahmaputra downstream—is contributed by catchment areas within India.

Research shows that while nearly 50 percent of the Yarlung Tsangpo-Brahmaputra River basin lies within Chinese territory, it contributes only a fraction of the river’s total discharge.

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report, China accounts for about 30 percent of the Brahmaputra’s flow, though other studies suggest the figure could be as low as seven percent.

In response to the perceived threat of the new Chinese mega-dam, India is moving to fast-track the construction of its own hydropower dam on the river on its side. It wants to use it as a buffer against sudden water discharges from China.

In a recent meeting, Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar asked his Chinese counterpart for cooperation on trans-border rivers.

China and India don’t have a formal water treaty that allows close cooperation on how to use shared rivers.

Trust between the two of the world’s most populous countries remains low, especially after the 2020 deadly military clash between Indian and Chinese forces over the disputed Himalayan border in Ladakh.

While recent high-level talks between the two nations have indicated a desire to “gradually improve relations”, water security is now emerging as a long-term flashpoint in their bilateral ties."

As many as 11 Thai civilians and one soldier are among the deceased, Thailand's health minister, Somsak Thepsuthin, confirmed.

Thepsuthin told reporters that Cambodia's actions, including an attack on a hospital, should be considered war crimes.

Thailand's military has placed the number of people wounded at 14 so far.

Thailand's Education Ministry closed schools near the border in Surin’s Phanom Dong Rak district. Cambodia also evacuated students and teachers from the impacted areas.

Two civilians were killed and two were injured when a Cambodian rocket targeted a border development centre in Karb Choeng district of Surin, Thailand's public broadcaster said. The victims included an eight-year-old boy.

The Thai army denounced Cambodia for firing rockets at the centre. It said that two BM-21 missiles, fired by Cambodian forces, smashed into the community centre at 9.40 am (02.40 GMT).

Thailand’s military said Cambodian troops opened fire first with heavy weapons, while Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defence said its troops acted in self-defence after coming under attack.

One civilian death was reported in the Ubon Ratchathani province and eight people, including a 15-year-old boy, and one military personnel were killed when Cambodian rockets fell into a supermarket at a petrol station in Ban Phue in Kanthararak district in Sisaket province.

The latest clash occurred a day after a Thai soldier lost his leg in a landmine explosion.

Of the six F-16 fighter jets that Thailand has readied to deploy along the disputed border, one of the aircraft fired into Cambodia and destroyed a military target, the Thai army said.

Both countries accused each other of starting the clash early on Thursday.

Cambodia on Thursday announced it is downgrading diplomatic ties with Thailand and has recalled all of its diplomatic staff from Bangkok, according to a report by Khmer Times, citing the country's Foreign Ministry.

All Cambodian diplomatic staff stationed at the Cambodian Embassy in Bangkok have been ordered to return home.

It comes a day after Thailand expelled the Cambodian ambassador and recalled its envoy from Phnom Penh over the landmine explosion incident.

The squabble has dragged on for decades, flaring into bloody military clashes more than 15 years ago and again in May, when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a firefight.

Fresh fighting erupted on Thursday morning near two temples on the border between the Thai province of Surin and Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey.

""Artillery shell fell on people's homes,"" Sutthirot Charoenthanasak, district chief of Kabcheing in Thailand's Surin province, told Reuters, describing the firing by the Cambodian side.

He said district authorities had evacuated 40,000 civilians from 86 villages near the border to safer locations.

Cambodian PM requests ‘urgent’ UNSC meeting

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet on Thursday requested the UN Security Council convene an ""urgent meeting"".

""Considering the recent extremely grave aggressions by Thailand, which have gravely threatened peace and stability in the region, I earnestly request you to convene an urgent meeting of the Security Council to stop Thailand's aggression,"" Hun Manet wrote in a letter addressed to the sitting UN Security Council president Asim Iftikhar Ahmad.

Six armed Cambodian soldiers, including one carrying a rocket-propelled grenade, approached a barbed-wired fence in front of the Thai post, the army said.

Thai soldiers shouted to warn them, the army said, but around 8:20 am, Cambodian forces opened fire toward the eastern side of the temple, about 200 metres from the Thai base.

Thailand's acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said ""the situation requires careful handling, and we must act in accordance with international law"".

""We will do our best to protect our sovereignty,"" he said.

Thailand, Cambodia must 'stand down' over border clash: Malaysian PM

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Thursday called on Thailand and Cambodia to ""stand down"" following the deadly border clashes between the two Southeast Asian neighbours.

""The least we can expect is for them to stand down and hopefully try to enter into negotiation,"" said Anwar, whose country currently chairs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) which includes Phnom Penh and Bangkok.

China expresses ‘deep concern’

Separately, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian expressed ""deep concern"" over the conflict and urged dialogue and consultation to solve the border dispute.

Lin reiterated China's ""just and impartial stance"" and said Beijing will continue to ""promote talks for peace"" and ""play a constructive role"" in de-escalation between Thailand and Cambodia."
7/23/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/5081f8ade0cf,Genesis 12:3 — The Bible verse that far-right Americans misinterpret to defend IsraelThey say God commands it. The Bible says otherwise.,"Washington, DC — ""I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse.""

To many American Evangelicals, this Genesis 12:3 verse is more than scripture; it's a foreign policy mandate.

Cited on Capitol Hill and across pulpits in red-state America, the verse is used to justify unwavering US support for Israel despite the separation of church and state, and to brand any deviation from that line as spiritual betrayal.

But the verse, weaponised recently by Republican Senator Ted Cruz, in a televised exchange with Tucker Carlson, never actually mentions Israel.

In fact, it never did.

So where did the Israel connection come from? And why has this single verse, devoid of geopolitical context, become central to the American Christian Right's worldview?

1909 Reference Bible that changed everything

The idea that Genesis 12:3 refers to Israel can be traced back to a single source: the Scofield Reference Bible, published in 1909. The Bible's footnotes, not its text, made the leap, suggesting the verse referred to Israel.

Biblical scholars say it was a stretch then, and it remains a misreading today.

""The Scofield (Reference) Bible, with its footnotes and commentary, was written before the State of Israel was even established, so clearly it cannot refer to the State of Israel,"" Jonathan Kuttab, co-founder of the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq, tells TRT World.

""But it does reflect Christian Zionist thinking that the End Times will be preceded by a Gathering of the Jews into Palestine, and a major battle (Armageddon) where all the Jews will be slaughtered except for a small minority who will convert to Christianity.""

Kuttab adds, ""Christian Zionism actually preceded Jewish Zionism, the latter being a secular movement without religious significance.""

He explains that the verse refers to the ""seed of Abraham"", which is not modern Israel or even biological descendants of Abraham, but ""Jesus Christ, and through him will all the nations of the world be blessed.""

He's not alone in this view.

Reverend Dr Donald Wagner, a Presbyterian clergyman and veteran Middle East analyst, says Genesis 12:3 refers to a covenant with Abraham — not a political state created in 1948.

""Genesis 12:3 states that God initiates a Covenant with Abraham, and it is an assumption Israel is included, but this is not the case. There are four uses of Israel in the Bible, and none of them imply or mean a modern state,"" Wagner tells TRT World.

""In a Biblical covenant, God is the initiator, and there are conditions. They are stated throughout the first five books of the law, and they include keeping the commandments, the first of which is to have no other gods other than the one God, Yahweh or Elohim.""

He adds: ""In several texts, the children of Abraham are warned that if they violate the covenant (no killing, no stealing, no idolatry), the land can be lost. And they do lose the land.""

Gary Burge, a New Testament Scholar, stressed that only select Evangelicals in the US believe that the verse refers to Israel, but said, ""There are countless things wrong with this argument.""

""This is a promise for Abraham's immediate context with Egypt — and his descendants are supposed to create a temple-centred religious nation. Modern Israel is none of these,"" Burge tells TRT World.

'Narrow understanding of identity'

Even if Evangelicals want to apply the verse to Abraham's descendants, that logic may have its own problems.

The Torah makes a distinction between the blessings of Ishmael (the father of Arabs) and his brother Isaac.

In it, the blessings of Abraham run uniquely through Isaac and Jacob (the prophet later known as Israel), but both Old and New Testament prophets reject this.

""Because some people think the promises and blessings follow ethnic lines, then you must have the Jewish ethnicity to benefit from them,"" Burge says.

""It is an ethnic argument. However, the OT (Old Testament) prophets and especially the NT (New Testament) reject this narrow understanding of identity,"" he adds.

Many Jews in Israel today are of Ashkenazi descent. Among them is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, born to secular Jewish parents.

Who is Scofield, and what does his reference entail?

So, who was Cyrus Scofield, the man who helped fuse biblical prophecy with modern Zionism?

He was, by most accounts, a deeply flawed figure. A war veteran who struggled with alcohol abuse and abandoned his wife and children. A lawyer who resigned in disgrace after bribery allegations. A man once jailed for forging his own sister's signature.

Yet it was his reference Bible, peppered with unverified commentary, that helped embed the Israel-Genesis connection in American Evangelical consciousness.

Jesse Wheeler, Associate Executive Director at Friends of Sabeel–North America: A Christian Voice for Palestine, calls it ""deeply problematic.""

""The issue is less about the translation so much as the inclusion of Scofield’s notes/commentary within the pages of scripture and their elevation almost to the point of sacred text itself,"" Wheeler tells TRT World.

""This reference Bible includes a type of fundamentalist Christian theology called premillennial dispensationalism,"" he says. ""It implies God favours the Jewish people and a modern Israel that will be the location of the final prophetic events, such as the return of Jesus and the final battle between evil, the devil, and a militarised Israel.""

""This is a human invention and is not consistent with the Hebrew prophets or Jesus’ life and teachings. In fact, Jesus rejects using the Bible or religious ideas to predict the future and particularly a militant interpretation of the final days.""

Burge says, ""Very few evangelicals use it in the US. But it was a dispensational project that believed in the ethnic exclusivity of the Jews in the programme of God, and these things were inserted into its footnotes.""

For Kuttab, the motivation for misreading the verse isn't theological — it's political.

""Those who exclude not only Arabs, but also Christians from the label 'children of Abraham' do so for political reasons that have nothing to do with theology or religion,"" he says."
7/23/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/743d1f99e054,"Behind closed doors at Davos: Klaus Schwab faces reckoning over legacy and leadershipOnce undisputed face of Davos, Klaus Schwab now faces allegations of inappropriate conduct and lavish, questionable expenses as WEF probe shakes foundations of institution he created.","Washington, DC, — For decades, Klaus Schwab greeted the world's most powerful with the poise of a monarch and the polish of a Swiss watch. Davos was his court.

The World Economic Forum — his creation, his brand, his stage — turned into a go-to conclave of capitalism where titans mingled with techies and heads of state brushed past climate activists.

Now, Schwab finds himself at the centre of an internal investigation, one triggered by a whistleblower, steered by a Zurich law firm, and punctuated by whispers of intimidation, excess and impropriety. It's the first time the Forum's founder has become its most fragile liability.

The 87-year-old German economist stepped down as executive chairman in April. The announcement, formal and measured, came with the dignity of a founder passing the torch. ""Throughout this journey,"" Schwab said in a written statement, ""Hilde and I never used the Forum for personal enrichment.""

But behind the glassy calm of the Alpine summit, tensions had been building.

The Swiss law firm Homburger was quietly brought in to lead a governance probe, after internal complaints alleged misconduct stretching back over a decade, including workplace bullying, inappropriate behaviour, and more than $1.1 million in questionable travel expenses. Preliminary findings reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and Swiss paper SonntagsZeitung were shared confidentially with Forum trustees this summer.

The expenses included luxury trips to the Seychelles, Morocco, and Miami, often with Schwab's wife Hilde, came with what investigators described as ""little or no evidence of business being involved."" Hilde chaired the Schwab Foundation but held no formal role within the WEF.

Schwab, through a spokesman, ""broadly rejected the findings."" He went further, accusing the board of breaching confidentiality after parts of the probe surfaced in the press.

""The board of trustees is in no way honouring the agreement reached on media restraint,"" he said in a statement. ""I feel deceived… I am not available for further investigations.""

That line drew a red one between founder and forum. What began as a closed-door review now teeters on the edge of institutional rupture.

""I am willing to defend my interests with all my strength,"" Schwab warned, ""even in the context of a legal dispute.""

At the heart of the probe is not just money or travel but culture, conduct, and power. Investigators cited a pattern of behaviour they described as overreaching.

Schwab, they noted, acted as if the Forum were his ""fiefdom,"" often intervening in editorial publications, pressing staff, and directing benefits toward Hilde.

Among the most sensitive allegations: gendered behaviour and inappropriate comments. One example cited in the report is a June 2020 suggestive email Schwab sent to a senior female staffer.

Conflict of interestSchwab, through his spokesman, said the emails ""didn’t reflect his character."" He viewed the Forum, he added, ""like a family"" and saw himself as a ""father figure"" to many young staffers.

But for some women — particularly those pregnant or over 40 — investigators said career paths were blocked, contributions sidelined, and morale battered.

The picture echoes a 2023 Wall Street Journal expose, which described a ""toxic culture"" for women and Black employees. The new probe adds further weight and a paper trail.

In one incident, Schwab allegedly pushed Forum researchers to revise content in the influential Global Competitiveness Report. In another, investigators flagged a project at Villa Mundi, a lakeside property near Geneva, as a potential conflict of interest.

Succession planning, too, has grown murkier. Schwab had intended to remain as chair until 2027.

In May, he told The Financial Times that ECB President Christine Lagarde had ""discussed cutting short her term"" to take the helm. But that possibility now appears remote.

In its only public statement since Schwab’s resignation, the Forum’s board chose to look back, not ahead: ""The Board acknowledged the outstanding achievements of the retired Chairman and Founder of the World Economic Forum, Klaus Schwab. He created the leading global platform for dialogue and progress.""

That platform now finds itself at a crossroads, confronting an air of uncertainty to its legacy and future trajectory.

Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, the Forum’s vice chairman and former Nestlé CEO, has stepped in as interim chair. A search is underway for a permanent successor.

But even as the legal review nears completion, with final recommendations expected by next month, the Forum's deeper challenge appears to be existential. Rebuilding trust. Reimagining leadership. And disentangling a global institution from the singular figure who defined it for more than 50 years."

Acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said on Wednesday that an investigation by the Thai military found evidence that Cambodia had laid new landmines in the disputed area.

A long-running territorial row in an area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of both countries and Laos meet, boiled over into military clashes in May that left one Cambodian soldier dead.

Since then, the two sides have traded barbs and tit-for-tat retaliatory measures, with Thailand restricting border crossings and Cambodia halting certain imports.

Five members of a Thai military patrol were wounded by the landmine on Wednesday afternoon in the Nam Yuen district of northeastern Ubon Ratchathani province, the Thai army said.

In response, the government agreed to an army proposal to close a number of border checkpoints, he said in a statement to journalists.

""It has also decided to downgrade diplomatic relations by recalling the Thai ambassador to Cambodia and expelling Cambodia's ambassador to Thailand,"" he said.

The Thai army said in a statement that, as well as the soldier who lost his leg, others suffered ear injuries and chest pain in the blast.

The army chief will visit the wounded soldiers on Thursday.

The border dispute has soured relations between Phnom Penh and Bangkok, prompting the closure of border crossings and Cambodia blocking imports of fuel and gas as well as fruit and vegetables from Thailand.

It also kicked off a domestic political crisis in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has been suspended from office pending an ethics probe over her conduct during the row.

A diplomatic call between Paetongtarn and Hun Sen, Cambodia's former longtime ruler and father of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, was leaked from the Cambodian side, sparking a judicial investigation.

Last week, Hun Manet announced that Cambodia would start conscripting civilians next year, activating a long-dormant mandatory draft law.

He said the tensions with Thailand meant conscription was needed, and the defence budget may also be increased."

7/22/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/c463bb603a61,Why Epstein scandal keeps coming back with Maxwell in focusUS Justice Department signals a shift as Deputy AG Todd Blanche contacts Ghislaine Maxwell while House Oversight Committee moves to subpoena her over ties to Jeffrey Epstein.,"Washington, DC, — The ghost of Jeffrey Epstein still stalks America's corridors of power, and it's now splitting the Republican base.

Ghislaine Maxwell, a convicted trafficker, is once again in the spotlight. Meanwhile, the White House faces mounting questions, and Congress remains divided over how to proceed.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche confirmed on Tuesday that he plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, the former British socialite and Epstein confidante convicted in 2021 of grooming children for sexual exploitation, ""in the coming days.""The quiet overture came just days after the Department of Justice doubled down on its conclusion that Epstein had no ""client list"" and was not murdered in his Manhattan jail cell.

""If Ghislaine Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,"" Blanche wrote on X. “At the direction of Attorney General Bondi, I have communicated with counsel for Ms Maxwell… I anticipate meeting with Ms Maxwell in the coming days.”

But what should have been a footnote in a long-dead case has become political fuel for a fire that won't go out.

A full-throated backlash has erupted from inside the MAGA (Make America Great Again) tent against the DOJ’s findings, against President Donald Trump's own stance, and against the Republican leadership accused of ""trying to shut this down.""

Meanwhile, Maxwell's lawyer, David Oscar Markus, confirmed negotiations for a meeting are underway. ""She will always testify truthfully,"" he said. ""We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.""

But that ""commitment"" hasn't calmed the waters.

On Capitol Hill, Republican lawmakers are launching their own Epstein offensive that appears to be at odds with the White House.

The House Oversight Subcommittee on Government Operations voted to subpoena Maxwell on Tuesday, in a surprise voice vote backed by three Republicans and a lone Democrat.

Congressman Tim Burchett of Tennessee introduced the motion. According to Axios, Burchett ""did not consult Donald Trump beforehand.""

Oversight Chair James Comer, who greenlit the move, also said he had not informed either Trump or House Speaker Mike Johnson.

""She's the last one standing. There's nobody else alive that can tell us anything ... I'd like to get her there before she's allowed to commit suicide as well. I'm just tired of it,"" Burchett told reporters.

Even as Trump calls the Epstein controversy a ""hoax,"" ordering Attorney General Pam Bondi to release any available grand jury testimony, the narrative continues to ricochet through Washington.

A Wall Street Journal report last week detailing Trump’s social ties with Epstein in the 1990s triggered fresh scrutiny, despite vehement denial by the President.

The same day as the DOJ's press release, Speaker Mike Johnson accused Democrats of weaponising the Epstein case for political gain.

""The president himself has said that he wants maximum transparency and all credible evidence to be turned over to the American public, so that everyone can make their own decisions. We’re owed that,"" Johnson added.

Currently, the Speaker is holding off on any action related to the Epstein investigation, even as Republican lawmakers demand a vote. With the legislative schedule in disarray, he's sending the House into recess a day early for a month-long break.""There’s no purpose for the Congress to push an administration to do something they're already doing,"" Johnson said on Tuesday.

Jeffrey Epstein, a financier with ties to global elites, was arrested in 2019 for sex trafficking and found dead weeks later in a New York jail, ruled a suicide. Ghislaine Maxwell, his associate, was later jailed for helping him abuse minors.

For now, Maxwell remains in federal prison in Florida, serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking and conspiracy. But the legal fight isn’t over.

US lawmakers have voted to subpoena Maxwell over Epstein's alleged “client list” as the story continues to grip Washington and dominate political chatter online.

Her lawyers have petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing that her prosecution violated a non-prosecution agreement Epstein secured in 2008. The justices are expected to consider the case later this year.

The question, presented in legalese but freighted with political weight, is whether a promise made by one federal prosecutor binds the entire Department of Justice.

It’s the kind of arcane, procedural point that typically draws little attention outside legal circles. But in the context of Maxwell and Epstein, it may drag the scandal — and its political fallout — deep into the fall and beyond.

Blanche was clear that the DOJ’s findings haven’t changed since the last public summary of the case.

""No evidence was uncovered that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,"" he said.

But for those on the Hill, that’s not enough.

“This (Maxwell) deposition will help the American people understand how Jeffrey Epstein was able to carry out his evil actions for so long without being brought to justice,” Burchett said in a statement.

That tension between the official line and the undercurrent of distrust is now pushing the Epstein case out of the shadows again."

The two leaders on Tuesday reviewed progress on Türkiye’s planned procurement of 40 Eurofighter Typhoon jets, a move that Ankara says would enhance NATO’s collective defence and bilateral cooperation with London.

The aircraft, jointly manufactured by the UK, Germany, Italy, and Spain, has been the subject of months-long negotiations, with the UK supporting the sale but facing resistance from Germany.

Last week, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz signalled a potential breakthrough, raising hopes that Berlin may soon drop its objections to the deal.

The Turkish side also expressed optimism that efforts to modernise the Türkiye–UK Free Trade Agreement would yield results by the end of the year.

Turning to the situation in Gaza, Erdogan warned that the humanitarian crisis is worsening and that deaths from starvation are continuing.

In a statement on Tuesday, the ministry said international inaction and silence have become a “cover” for Israel to continue its crimes, warning that failure to uphold international law risks replacing global legitimacy with “the law of the jungle.”

The statement comes amid a surge in attacks by illegal Israeli settlers and military raids in the occupied West Bank.

In the early hours of Tuesday, extremist Israeli settlers torched two Palestinian vehicles and vandalised property in the village of Beitin, east of Ramallah. In the nearby town of Turmus Ayya, settlers broke into a Palestinian home and stole part of its contents, eyewitnesses told Anadolu.

According to Abdullah Abbas, a 73-year-old resident of Beitin whose vehicle was destroyed, the attacks occurred while Israeli forces were present in the area. “This is the reality of occupation,” he said.

Data from the Palestinian Wall and Settlement Resistance Commission shows that illegal Jewish settlers carried out more than 2,150 attacks in the first half of 2025 alone, leaving at least four Palestinians dead.

Simultaneously, Israeli forces stormed the cities of Tubas and Tammun in the northern West Bank, raiding homes and commercial buildings. Witnesses reported heavy military reinforcements and low-flying reconnaissance drones during the raid.

Since the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, nearly 1,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 7,000 injured in the occupied West Bank by Israeli forces and illegal settlers, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.

In a landmark opinion last July, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem."

Speaking at a press conference in Damascus on Tuesday, committee head Jumaa Al-Anzi and spokesperson Yasser Al-Farhan presented the findings of the months-long investigation.

According to the panel, approximately 200,000 armed security forces launched a coordinated operation on the coast, aiming to “reclaim the area from remnants of the former regime.” The coastal region had remained a stronghold of loyalist forces even after the collapse of the Assad regime in late 2024.

Use of sectarian rhetoric

The committee said that the scale and intensity of the assault led to widespread violations.

It added that not all fighters were aligned with the current transitional government, and that unauthorised elements were responsible for acts of killing, looting, and the use of sectarian rhetoric during the clashes.

The report marks the first official toll from the coastal violence, which triggered waves of displacement and raised concerns over renewed instability in post-Assad Syria.

A new round of nuclear negotiations between Iran and the three European countries known as the E3, the UK, France, and Germany, is set to take place in Istanbul, Türkiye, on Friday.

Earlier, Tehran said it would host Russian and Chinese officials on Tuesday to discuss its nuclear programme.

“We are in constant consultation with these two countries to prevent activation of the snapback or to mitigate its consequences,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei told a news briefing in Tehran, cited by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.

""We have no plans to hold talks with the US in the current situation,” Baghaei said. Talks between Tehran and the US were being held through Omani mediators until Israel’s surprise attack on Iran on June 13, which triggered a 12-day war.

The attack came just two days before a planned sixth round of negotiations in the Omani capital, Muscat.

Iran accused the US of complicity in the Israeli attack, which killed top Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists, and civilians. The US also launched strikes on three major Iranian nuclear sites, claiming to have obliterated them. A ceasefire took effect on June 24."

In a statement on Monday, GCC Secretary-General Jassem Al-Budaiwi held Israel fully responsible for the worsening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, warning that the deliberate policy of collective starvation amounts to a full-fledged war crime that requires urgent international accountability.

Al-Budaiwi said the Israeli siege and denial of aid had led to the spread of famine and the collapse of health and food systems in Gaza, warning that the Palestinian territory is facing “a humanitarian catastrophe of unprecedented scale.”

He urged the international community to act immediately and unconditionally to stop the siege, ensure the swift and unhindered entry of food and medical supplies, and prevent further atrocities against the Palestinian people.

“This brutal blockade challenges all international humanitarian norms, violates the Geneva Conventions, and undermines the values and principles of human rights,” al-Budaiwi said, warning that the situation in Gaza “exceeds all thresholds of humanitarian decency.”

The GCC also called on all international bodies and organisations to take serious measures to stop the killing, lift the siege, and prevent further starvation-related deaths. It reiterated the need to reopen border crossings without delay and save the lives of innocent civilians.

Al-Budaiwi reaffirmed the GCC’s support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to life, freedom, and national self-determination, in line with international law and the Arab Peace Initiative, which offers Israel full recognition in exchange for withdrawal from Arab lands.

Rejecting international calls for a ceasefire, the Israeli army has pursued a brutal offensive on Gaza since Oct. 7, 2023, killing nearly 59,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children. The relentless bombardment has destroyed the enclave and led to food shortages and a spread of disease.

Last November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

According to Belgian media reports, the arrests followed urgent legal complaints filed by the Hind Rajab Foundation and the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN) earlier this week. The soldiers were detained at the Tomorrowland music festival in Boom, Belgium.

After examining the case, prosecutors decided they had jurisdiction under Article 14/10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which grants Belgian courts extraterritorial authority over international crimes such as war crimes covered by the Geneva Conventions and torture as defined by the UN Convention Against Torture.

Following these developments, police located and formally interviewed the two soldiers before releasing them. Belgian authorities have confirmed that a criminal investigation is ongoing but declined to provide further details.

In a statement, the Hind Rajab Foundation welcomed the move as ""a turning point in the global pursuit of accountability,"" noting it was the first time in Europe that Israeli suspects linked to alleged war crimes in Gaza were arrested and questioned.

""To the victims and survivors in Gaza: we see you, we hear you, and we carry your demands for justice forward. To those who believed impunity was permanent: this moment shows that it is not,"" the foundation said, calling for the investigation to be pursued fully and independently.

Israel has killed over 59,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, in the Gaza Strip since October 2023. The genocidal military attacks have devastated the enclave, collapsed the health system, and led to severe food shortages and deaths by starvation.

The ruling coalition of the LDP and Komeito won around 41 of the 125 seats contested, short of the 50 needed to retain a majority, Nippon TV and TBS projected based on exit polls on Monday.

Early projections showed that the coalition was unlikely to retain its majority in the crucial elections, with the ruling bloc and opposition locked in a neck-and-neck contest to secure the 125 seats in the 248-member House of Councillors.

Nationwide voter turnout stood at an estimated 58.52 percent as of 4 am Monday, Japan Today reported, higher than the 52.05 percent seen in the previous Upper House election in 2022.

The LPD is still the single largest party in the Upper House, with initial reports suggesting that the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) is positioned to be the second largest party.

Ishiba vows to carry on

Ishiba said he is determined to remain in office despite the expected blow to his party.

""We must humbly and sincerely accept the harsh situation,"" he told a news conference, NHK reported.

Asked if he intends to remain as prime minister and ruling party leader, he said: ""That's right.""

""We are engaged in extremely critical tariff negotiations with the US...We must never derail these negotiations,"" he added, referring to efforts to beat an August 1 deadline for higher US tariffs.

He said the LDP is still the largest party in parliament by any measure and thus has a major responsibility to deliver results.

The Sanseito party, which is likely to gain several seats in the election, may link up with the LDP, ""depending on policy coordination,"" said party leader Sohei Kamiya, according to Kyodo News.

The Sanseito party emerged as one of the biggest winners in Japan's upper house election on Sunday, gaining support with warnings of a ""silent invasion"" of immigrants, and pledges for tax cuts and welfare spending.

Birthed on YouTube during the Covid-19 pandemic, spreading conspiracy theories about vaccinations and a cabal of global elites, the party broke into mainstream politics with its ""Japanese First"" campaign.

The party won 14 seats, according to public broadcaster NHK, adding to the single lawmaker it secured in the 248-seat chamber three years ago. It has only three seats in the more powerful lower house.

Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), denied that his party is in any ""grand coalition"" with the LDP, Kyodo reported.

If Ishiba continues as premier, the CPD is reportedly considering a vote of no confidence against him.

No other opposition party has indicated that they will support Ishiba in the upper house.

Millions of voters headed to nearly 45,000 polling stations nationwide to elect 125 lawmakers for the Upper House of parliament in a crucial test for the Ishiba-led ruling coalition, which already lost its majority in the lower house last year.

The last time the LDP lost its majority in the upper house was in 2007."

“Turkish Cypriots will forever live free in their own homeland, with Türkiye's support, no matter what anyone says,” Erdogan declared during an address in Lefkosa to mark the 51st anniversary of Türkiye’s 1974 Cyprus Peace Operation.

Reaffirming Türkiye’s backing for a two-state solution, Erdogan said it was time to move beyond the “outdated, UN-backed federation model,” which he said has repeatedly failed.

“Turkish Cypriots can’t afford to lose another 60 years,” he added, criticising persistent efforts to impose a solution that “the Turkish Cypriots have clearly withdrawn their support from.” He said, “Insisting on a solution model that has failed many times benefits no one.”

Calls for direct trade, flights with the TRNC

The Turkish president urged the international community to establish direct diplomatic and economic ties with the TRNC, including the launch of direct flights and trade, saying these steps were necessary for peace and stability on the island.

“Despite Greek Cypriot attempts to present themselves as the ‘sole authority’ on the island, the TRNC is now represented in Turkic and Islamic international organisations,” he noted.

Erdogan emphasised the historic significance of the 1974 military operation, launched in response to a Greek Cypriot coup backed by Greece, which triggered ethnic violence against Turkish Cypriots.

“With the landing of Turkish soldiers on the island during the Cyprus Peace Operation, the whole world saw that the Turkish Cypriots did not stand alone,” he said.

Erdogan emphasised Türkiye’s enduring support despite international isolation of the TRNC, which declared independence in 1983.

“No matter which door they close to block the Turkish Cypriots’ path, we have always found new doors to open, new paths to take,” he added.

Cyprus has remained divided since 1974, when a Greek Cypriot coup backed by Athens led to Türkiye's intervention as a guarantor power to protect Turkish Cypriots from ethnic violence.

A series of UN-led negotiations have since failed to produce a lasting settlement.

A notable effort collapsed in 2017 in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, under the auspices of guarantor nations Türkiye, Greece, and the UK.

Erdogan also highlighted Türkiye’s investment in the development of the TRNC, saying:

“Not only in transportation but also in tourism, employment, and investments, we have made the TRNC the shining star of the Eastern Mediterranean.”

‘Realities on the island’

While the Greek Cypriot administration entered the European Union in 2004, it simultaneously rejected a UN reunification plan approved by Turkish Cypriots, widening the island’s political divide.

Erdogan reiterated that it's time the international community recognises the reality on the ground.

“It is high time the global community comes to terms with the realities on the island,” he said.

Erdogan concluded his speech by affirming Türkiye’s continued commitment to the political equality and sovereignty of the Turkish Cypriot people."

Information Minister Hamza al-Mustafa said on Saturday that the steps taken in the southern province were aimed at protecting civilians and de-escalating tensions, not launching a military campaign.

He stressed that the government's response was not premeditated but came in reaction to the deteriorating security situation.

The government declared a new ceasefire on Saturday morning — its fourth in recent weeks — after renewed clashes broke out on Friday. Armed groups affiliated with senior Druze cleric Sheikh Hikmat al-Hajri were reported to have forcibly displaced members of Sunni Bedouin tribes and committed violations against them, triggering further violence.

Mustafa outlined that the latest ceasefire agreement includes deploying internal security forces to areas prone to clashes, establishing humanitarian corridors between Suwayda and neighboring Daraa, and reactivating government institutions across the province if the truce holds.

The goal, he said, is to prevent direct confrontations, evacuate civilians safely, and gradually restore state authority and normal life.

He accused Sheikh al-Hajri and his supporters of breaching previous agreements with the state and promoting rhetoric that invites foreign involvement.

In a strong rebuke, the minister said the Druze leader had made a “serious strategic error” by appealing to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which he warned could endanger the entire Sweida population.

Clashes erupted on July 13 between Bedouin Arab tribes and Druze militant groups, escalating into wider unrest.

In the aftermath, Israel carried out air strikes on Syrian military targets in and around Damascus, with the pretext of protecting Druze communities.

Damascus has rejected this justification and accused Israel of exploiting sectarian tensions.

External interference threatens national cohesion

Most Druze leaders inside Syria have publicly distanced themselves from external actors and reaffirmed their commitment to Syria’s unity and sovereignty. Mustafa said such disinformation campaigns and external interference threaten to inflame sectarian divides and undermine national cohesion.

Israel has intensified air strikes across southern Syria and formally declared the collapse of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement, effectively erasing the buffer zone along the occupied Golan Heights.

Despite these challenges, the Syrian government says it remains committed to safeguarding national unity, protecting all communities without discrimination, and resisting attempts to fragment the state through sectarian conflict or foreign intervention."

“We have just filed a POWERHOUSE Lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, FAKE NEWS ‘article’ in the useless ‘rag’ that is, The Wall Street Journal,” Trump wrote in a social media post.

The WSJ revealed on Thursday that a letter from Trump was included in an album that was created to celebrate the 50th birthday of the disgraced financier.

The leather-bound memento was compiled by Epstein’s long-time aide and convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell in 2003, according to the newspaper.

Trump’s lawsuit, which he called a “historic legal action”, targets WSJ reporters Khadeeja Safdar and Joseph Palazzolo, whose names appear in the article’s byline, as well as the newspaper, its parent companies News Corp and Dow Jones, Murdoch, and News Corp executive Robert Thomson.

Filed in a Miami federal court, it accuses the defendants of “clear journalistic failures” and claims that the newspaper were “false, defamatory, unsubstantiated, and disparaging”.

“I hope Rupert and his ‘friends’ are looking forward to the many hours of depositions and testimonies they will have to provide in this case,” the US president added on Truth Social.

The WSJ report came as Trump finds himself in a whirlwind with the Epstein files — the collection of government documents that the Justice Department has so far refused to make public, that is driving the largest wedge to date within the president’s Make America Great Again, or MAGA, movement, that he popularised during his 2026 and 2024 presidential campaigns.

The Justice Department announced last week that it determined Epstein died by suicide in 2019 and claimed he had no “client list”, sparking discontent among the president’s MAGA supporters.

Trump has called the Epstein scandal a “hoax” and demanded his supporters move on, even as they continue to clamour for the release of the documents, including the “client list” that Attorney General Pam Bondi said in February was “sitting on my desk right now.”"

The Journal story, which quickly reverberated around the US capital on Thursday, says the note to Epstein bearing Trump's signature was part of a collection of notes for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. The newspaper said it reviewed the letter but did not print an image.

The story said that Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's partner, was preparing a special gift to mark the occasion. She turned to Epstein's family and friends. One of them was Donald Trump.

Maxwell collected letters from Trump and dozens of Epstein's other associates for a 2003 birthday album, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

""After 14 years of suffering, the Syrian people now have a chance for peace and stability,"" Türkiye's UN envoy Ahmet Yildiz told the UN Security Council on Thursday.

""Despite many challenges, they have taken swift steps towards this goal. They have achieved remarkable progress in seven months,"" he said, emphasising that Syria's leadership is committed to an inclusive political transition and national reconciliation through broad engagement with various sectors of society.

Yildiz stressed that Türkiye has consistently supported Syria's recovery and peace process, and noted growing international consensus in favour of these efforts.

However, he warned that Israel's ""relentless attacks"" since December 8 aim to disrupt this momentum.

""Israel's ongoing aggression directly undermines Syria's rebuilding efforts on the basis of social cohesion,"" he said, noting that Israeli ""interventions and provocative statements threaten the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.""

""These attacks targeting Syria's Presidential Palace and Ministry of Defense have clearly demonstrated that Israel has no interest in the peace and stability of Syria or the region,"" Yildiz added.

Urging all member states to reject Israeli aggression, he warned that Israel's ""attacks destabilise the region and increase civilian casualties and displacement.""

""It is also concerning that the scale and geographic scope of these attacks have surpassed those previously directed at the fallen regime,"" he said.

He stressed the need to respect Syria's sovereignty and uphold the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement, concluding that ""it is the duty of the international community to demonstrate that Syrians will not walk this path alone.""

Clashes in Sweida, Israeli attacks

⁠On July 13, small-scale clashes broke out between Bedouin Arab tribes and armed Druze groups in Sweida province.

Dozens of soldiers were killed in attacks by Druze groups against security forces deployed to the area.

After the clashes escalated, a ceasefire was reached between the parties.

The ceasefire was broken shortly thereafter, and the Israeli army carried out attacks targeting Syrian security forces.

Late on Thursday, Israel struck the outskirts of Sweida.

Local reports claimed the village of Walga, in Sweida's countryside, was specifically targeted and that there were deaths and injuries among local Bedouin residents.

On July 16, the Israeli air force struck the Syrian presidential compound, the General Staff Headquarters and the Defense Ministry in the capital, Damascus.

On the same day, a ceasefire was reestablished between the government and local groups in Sweida, while Israeli warplanes carried out attacks on Damascus and Daraa.

Since the security forces have withdrawn from Sweida, it is estimated that hundreds have been killed in the fighting and Israeli attacks.

Earlier on Thursday, Türkiye and ten Arab countries reaffirmed their support for Syria's unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and condemned repeated Israeli strikes on its territory.

In a joint statement issued by the Saudi Foreign Ministry, the Foreign Ministers of Türkiye, Jordan, the UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon and Egypt expressed opposition to all foreign interference in Syria’s internal affairs.

The ministers welcomed the recent ceasefire in Sweida and called for its full implementation, describing the deal as vital to preserving Syria's unity, protecting civilians, and restoring the rule of law."

""We obviously, in the last four years, have consolidated our new policy that unless our sovereign equality and equal international status are reaffirmed, we will not resume formal negotiations for the resolution of the Cyprus problem,"" Tatar told reporters on Thursday at a news conference at UN headquarters in New York following an informal meeting on Cyprus.

""Because we believe very much that these assets, our sovereign equality and international status, are our inherent rights,"" he added.

Tatar noted that he came to the meeting ""with a positive, constructive and forward-looking agenda"" but expressed ""profound disappointment"" over incidents on the island following the previous informal meeting in Geneva in March.

""The actions of the Greek Cypriot leadership are causing Turkish Cypriot people to be anxious under pressure and increasingly threatened,"" he said.

Saying that ""many Turkish Cypriots are in fear over being arrested or detained in the event they cross to South Cyprus or when traveling abroad,"" Tatar reaffirmed that ""there are two states and two democracies, which reflect the will of the Turkish Cypriot people and the Greek Cypriot people, which have been in existence in Cyprus for the last six years.""

""If there is to be a new and formal negotiation process, it must be based on the realities on the ground, treating the two sides equally, fairly and with dignity,"" he added.

Tatar also said they had aimed to announce the opening of four crossing points following the meeting, but this could not be realised, expressing deep regret over it.

""At the end of the day, the whole thing depended on the Greek Cypriots insisting that they will go through the buffer zone for military purposes and other territorial matters,"" he said, stressing that it is ""something that the Turkish side could not possibly have accepted.""

He further noted that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres ""did his best"" to achieve progress on this issue, but due to the Greek Cypriots' stance, a solution could not be found to this ""simple problem.""

Responding to a question from Anadolu Agency on recent progress in mine clearance, Tatar said: ""Our aim is to have a mine-free island all together.""

He affirmed that the issue stems from the Greek Cypriot side wanting only certain areas to be cleared of mines while insisting that some areas remain untouched.

""For the time being, our policy is to make sure that we are free of all mines, you know, all over the place,"" he said.

The Turkish Cypriot leader further announced that he will meet again with the Greek Cypriot leader during the UN General Assembly in September and that the next broader-format informal meeting is planned to take place at the end of the year.

Cyprus has been mired in a decades-long dispute between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, despite a series of diplomatic efforts by the UN to achieve a comprehensive settlement.

Ethnic attacks starting in the early 1960s forced Turkish Cypriots to withdraw into enclaves for their safety.

In 1974, a Greek Cypriot coup aimed at Greece's annexation of the island led to Türkiye's military intervention as a guarantor power to protect Turkish Cypriots from persecution and violence.

As a result, the TRNC was founded in 1983.

It has seen an on-and-off peace process in recent years, including a failed 2017 initiative in Switzerland under the auspices of guarantor countries Türkiye, Greece and the UK.

The Greek Cypriot Administration entered the EU in 2004, the same year that Greek Cypriots single-handedly blocked a UN plan to end the longstanding dispute."
7/17/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/5f12f8d48ea3,Trump diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after leg swelling and hand bruisingWhite House discloses diagnosis while responding to recent concerns over swelling in the US President's legs and visible bruising on his hand.,"US President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with a chronic vein condition, the White House said, following speculation about his heavily bruised hand and swollen legs.

The 79-year-old, who in January 2025 became the oldest person ever to assume the presidency, was found to have ""chronic venous insufficiency,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday.

The widely noted discoloration on Trump's right hand, meanwhile, was ""tissue irritation from frequent handshaking"" and the use of aspirin as part of a standard cardiovascular treatment, she said.

Presidential physician Sean Barbabella said Trump ""remains in excellent health"" despite the condition, in a letter released by the White House.

The Republican frequently boasts of his good health and energy levels, while the administration recently even posted an image depicting him as Superman.

Trump has alleged that Democrats covered up the mental and physical decline of his predecessor, Joe Biden, who was 82 when he left office in January.

Leavitt's revelations follow widespread online discussions about the president's visibly swollen ankles, seen in particular at the recent FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey, and a bruised hand that often appeared to be covered with make-up.

""In recent weeks, President Trump noted mild swelling in his lower legs,"" Leavitt said, adding that he was examined by White House doctors ""out of an abundance of caution.""

Ultrasound tests ""revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70.""

The condition involves damaged leg veins that fail to keep blood flowing properly.

Leavitt said Trump had asked her to share the diagnosis ""in the effort of transparency.""

Dr. Matt Heinz, an internist and hospitalist from Tucson, Arizona, told AFP that chronic venous insufficiency is ""pretty common,"" especially in older adults. It results from vein valves becoming less effective.

""It comes with age, gravity, and obesity doesn't help if that's a condition that people suffer from. I know the president's been losing some weight, though, so I think that’s probably a little better,"" he said.

The White House pressed home its message that the condition did not pose a serious risk to Trump, saying that ""importantly, there was no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.""

Trump had ""normal cardiac structure and function, no signs of heart failure, renal impairment or systemic illness,"" added Leavitt.

White House has commented after days of speculation regarding photographs showing bruising on Trump's hand.

Of the hand bruising issue, Leavitt said: ""This is a well-known and benign side effect of aspirin therapy.""

For months, however, the White House had previously dismissed questions about Trump's bruised hand, saying that it was purely down to handshaking.

The health of US presidents has always been closely watched, but with the White House seeing its two oldest ever occupants since 2017, the scrutiny is now heavier than ever.

Biden's health was a key issue in the 2024 election, and the then-president was forced to drop his campaign for a second term after a disastrous debate performance against Trump.

Republicans in the House of Representatives have issued subpoenas to several Biden aides, including his doctor, to get them to testify in an investigation into the Democrat's mental fitness.

Biden was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer in May.

As far as Trump was concerned, his condition was likely to be treated with compression socks, activity, and maybe weight loss, rather than any ""invasive"" treatment such as prosthetic valves, Heinz said.

Swelling could indicate something more serious such as heart issues ""but I don't have that information."""

Ensher tells TRT World.","Washington, DC — For the past several days, Israel has been conducting strikes in four areas of Syria – Sweida, Daraa, Damascus, and the Damascus countryside – resulting in the deaths and injuries of dozens of Syrians and exacerbating the chaos caused by a localised conflict involving fighters linked to a double-dealing Druze leader and Bedouin tribes.

For its part, the United States demanded that the Syrian government withdraw its military from the flashpoint area, which had been deployed to restore normalcy. It framed the Israeli strikes on Syria, including on the Defence Ministry in Damascus, as ""misunderstanding"" and vowed to help end Israeli strikes.

Yet, Israel continues to bomb Syrian parts on the pretext of ""protecting"" the Druze community.

The US, which has committed to stabilising Syria under one government, one flag, and one national army, has found its mission complicated by strikes from ally Israel.

Although Washington has voiced its displeasure regarding the attacks, it has refrained from condemning Tel Aviv.

""Washington is walking a tightrope,"" former US Ambassador Henry S. Ensher told TRT World, stressing the situation reflects a longstanding dilemma in US policy.

""It wants to protect Israeli security, but it also sees the value in helping Syria's new leadership stabilise the country and prevent further fragmentation or foreign domination.""

Ensher described the American position as one of ""concern but ambivalence,"" driven by overlapping interests in counterterrorism, regional influence, and avoiding escalation.

""The United States always wants to protect the interests of Israel and insists it has a right to defend itself,"" he said.

""But at the same time, there's also a desire to see Syria's new government succeed — to control its territory, prevent terrorism, and limit Iranian or Russian influence.""

Israel has repeatedly been striking Syria since the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime.

US President Donald Trump has sided with Türkiye and Saudi Arabia in seeking a better relationship with Syria under its new leader, Ahmed al Sharaa.

However, Tel Aviv appears to disapprove of this relationship. In its recent strikes, it targeted Syrian presidential compound, the General Staff Headquarters, and the Defence Ministry in Damascus.

Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir has even called for Israel to ""eliminate"" Syrian President al Sharaa.

Ensher told TRT World that Israeli attacks on central government targets in Damascus could become a flashpoint.

""Strikes taken in the heart of Damascus would normally be considered an act of war,"" Ensher said. ""I suspect there will be questions asked in Israel by the US about taking those steps.""

Israeli claims of Druze 'protection'

Israel has justified its strikes on Syria as a response to alleged threats against the Druze community in southern Syria. Druze leaders have largely accused Israel of using some Druze figures to stir unrest in Syria under the guise of protecting the community.

Ensher also cast doubt on the Israeli explanation.

""It appears the Israelis are playing an imperial role: trying to protect their Druze clans across a border, in another state,"" he said.

""That's essentially an imperial posture.""

He also pointed out that Syrian Druze leaders have consistently opposed foreign involvement in their affairs.

""They do not want Israeli involvement in their conflicts,"" he said.

""It's a very complicated landscape with a lot of history.""

Israeli aggression has come just weeks after a landmark meeting in Riyadh between US President Trump and Syrian President al Sharaa.

Hosted by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and joined virtually by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the summit was the first of its kind in over two decades.

Following the meeting, Trump pledged to a phased lifting of US sanctions in exchange for what officials called ""verifiable commitments"" from the Syrian government.

In turn, al Sharaa signalled openness to regional peace and reaffirmed Syria's 1974 disengagement agreement with Israel.

He also invited US companies to invest in Syria's energy sector.

The Riyadh summit also marked a shift in Washington's posture toward SDF - the Syrian branch of the PKK/YPG terror group - which had served as a US partner against Daesh.

Trump made clear that the responsibility for managing Daesh prisoners should now fall to Damascus, not a non-state militia.

That demand reflects growing American interest in consolidating state authority in Syria, rather than continuing to empower semi-autonomous forces.

Earlier this year, the SDF signed an eight-point agreement with the Syrian government, paving the way for the integration of its forces and administration into the national structure.

However, Israeli attacks, purportedly in support of a Druze minority, appear to sabotage American efforts.

Ensher told TRT World that US endorsement of Israeli strikes in Syria would depend on their intent and outcome.

""If Israel shows that its strikes are targeting Daesh, the US is likely to approve or even facilitate them,"" he said.

""But if it's about sectarian dynamics or asserting influence over groups like the Druze — or worse, attacking Damascus — that's another matter.""

While the US has not condemned the latest Israeli strikes, it has issued cautious calls for ""de-escalation"" and ""protection of religious minorities"" — language seen by analysts as tacit alignment with Israel's framing, without full endorsement.

""Washington is trying to manage both sides,"" Ensher added.

""They want to remain Israel's strategic partner but also help Syria stabilise. Too much pressure on Damascus could backfire."""

""We have set a clear policy: demilitarisation of the region south of Damascus — from the Golan Heights to the Jabal al-Druze area. That is our first line,"" Netanyahu said in a recorded statement on Thursday.

""The second line is protecting the Druze in the Jabal al-Druze region,"" he said, referring to the mountainous area known as Jabal al-Arab, or Jabal Hauran, which lies in Syria's Sweida province and includes dozens of towns and villages at elevations of more than 5,900 feet.

Netanyahu, repeating his false claims of being the protector of Syria's Druze minority, said the dual-track approach would remain Israel's policy.

""We will not allow military forces to deploy south of Damascus, and we will not allow harm to come to the Druze in Jabal al-Druze,"" he claimed.

Israel, which has been conducting a genocide of Palestinians since October 2023, has repeatedly invoked the ""protection of the Druze minority"" as a justification for military aggression in southern Syria, including attempts to create a demilitarised buffer zone along its disputed border.

Leading Druze figures in Syria have consistently rejected those claims, issuing a joint statement condemning foreign intervention and reaffirming their commitment to a unified Syria, rejecting division and separatism.

Netanyahu claims truce 'achieved by force'

In the same statement, Netanyahu admitted that the Israeli military had struck Syrian army positions in Sweida on Wednesday, saying he had added the Syrian Defence Ministry in Damascus as a direct target.

On Wednesday, Israel launched one of its most extensive attacks in recent months, with air strikes on more than 160 targets across four Syrian provinces: Sweida, Daraa, Damascus, and its countryside.

The strikes hit the General Staff headquarters and the vicinity of the presidential palace in the capital.

In the process, Israel killed more than 30 Syrians and wounded nearly 100, prompting strong condemnation from all quarters.

Despite the absence of a threat from Syria's new transitional government, Israel has carried out near-daily air raids in recent months, killing civilians and destroying military sites, equipment and ammunition.

Netanyahu claimed that a ceasefire had since been reached and Syrian forces had withdrawn to Damascus. ""That's important,"" he said.

""This ceasefire was achieved by force — not through requests or pleas, but by force.""

Earlier on Thursday, Türkiye's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned Tel Aviv’s continued aggression on Syria, warning Israel is a lawless, rule-breaking, unprincipled, arrogant, and terrorist state that exploits regional dynamics to justify its actions.

""Israel has been using the Druze as an excuse to move its banditry into neighbouring Syria for the past two days,"" Erdogan said. ""At this point, the biggest problem in our region is Israel’s aggression. If the monster (Israel) is not stopped now, it will set our region and the world on fire.""

Experts say the inability of the newly formed Syrian government's military structure to fully secure control is strengthening the hand of Hikmat al-Hijri, a double-dealing Druze warlord in Sweida who went from being a religious figure associated with Iran's Axis of Resistance to saying ""Israel is not the enemy"".

Israel has occupied most of Syria's Golan Heights since 1967.

Following the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in late 2024, Israel expanded its occupation in the Golan Heights and seized control of the Syrian demilitarised zone."

""What we know for sure is that a tank, the IDF says by mistake, but we are not sure about this. They hit the church directly,"" Pizzaballa told Vatican News.

Amid the outrage, Israel is framing the Gaza church bombing as ""a mistake"".

But it isn't a one-off. Israel has struck churches in Gaza several times since it began its genocide in Gaza.

Here is a timeline of major Israeli strikes on churches in Gaza since 2023.

Saint Porphyrius Church, Gaza City: Israel bombed a building within the Saint Porphyrius Church compound, where approximately 400–500 displaced Muslim and Christian Palestinians were sheltering.

The strike killed at least 18 people, including several children, and wounded many others. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem condemned the attack as a war crime.

The Israeli military claimed the church was not the intended target.

Al-Ahli Arab Hospital (Baptist Church Compound), Gaza: Israel targeted the courtyard of the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, part of the Baptist Church compound, which was sheltering displaced civilians.

Nearly 500 people, including patients and displaced civilians, were killed.

The attack drew widespread international condemnation, with rights groups noting it violated international humanitarian law protecting civilian infrastructure, including religious sites.

Holy Family Church, Gaza: Israel targeted the Catholic Holy Family Church in Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood, the only Catholic church in Gaza.

The strike killed three people: Saad Salameh (60, church janitor), Fumayya Ayyad (84), and Najwa Abu Daoud (69).

Several others, including parish priest Father Gabriel Romanelli, were wounded. Romanelli sustained leg wounds and was treated at Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital.

The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem reported serious damage to the church, and Pope Leo XIV called for an immediate ceasefire.

Gaza is predominantly Muslim, with approximately 1,000 Christians, mostly Greek Orthodox, according to a US State Department report.

Palestine's Christian population has decreased in recent years, with many emigrating due to conflict or seeking opportunities abroad.

Christian leaders often condemn attacks by illegal Israeli settlers, Jewish extremists and Israeli military.

In addition to churches, Israel has also destroyed dozens of mosques during the genocide, with many others severely damaged, according to the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor."

In its ruling, Pre-Trial Chamber I of the ICC said it had dismissed Israel’s dual request made on May 9, 2025: One seeking the withdrawal, cancellation, or invalidation of the arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, and another calling for the suspension of the prosecutor’s investigation into the situation in Palestine.

The court rejected Israel’s argument that the ICC lacks jurisdiction over crimes committed in the Palestinian territories, reaffirming its previous decisions.

It added that the Appeals Chamber’s ruling of April 24, 2025, could not be interpreted as undermining the court’s jurisdiction.

According to the decision, “suspension of the investigation is only applicable when a state challenges the admissibility of a case,” under Article 19(7) of the Rome Statute.

The judges noted that Israel had not filed such a challenge regarding admissibility.

The chamber also rejected Israel’s request to deny Palestine the opportunity to present its views, stating that the court already had sufficient information and did not require additional submissions.

The ICC ruled on Feb. 5, 2021, that Palestine is a State Party to the Rome Statute and that the court’s jurisdiction extends to Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, territories occupied by Israel since 1967.

The ICC Office of the Prosecutor officially opened an investigation into the situation in Palestine on March 3, 2021.

Israel challenged the court’s jurisdiction under Article 19(2) of the Rome Statute on Sept. 23, 2024.

The ICC’s Pre-Trial Chamber issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant on Nov. 21, 2024, citing alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity.

On April 24, 2025, the ICC Appeals Chamber annulled an earlier procedural ruling that had dismissed Israel’s objection as premature, referring the matter back to the Pre-Trial Chamber for a substantive decision."
7/16/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/1e24be861953,"Why Trump branded Epstein files a 'hoax', snubbing his own MAGA baseUS President dismisses Epstein saga as a scam and scorns those who believed it, as the very base that once lifted him to power now demands full transparency.","Washington, DC, — It begins not with a bombshell, but with a post — jagged, incisive, unmistakably Trump:

""Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'b****,' hook, line, and sinker… Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats’ work… I don’t want their support anymore!""

With that, the dam burst.

The movement that built Trump appears to have a meltdown. Not over taxes. Not over war. But over one ghost: Jeffrey Epstein.

The MAGA (Make America Great Again) movement has been in this mode ever since Trump's own Department of Justice concluded they have no evidence that sex offender Jeffrey Epstein kept a client list or was murdered in jail.

This contradicted a major MAGA talking point, and MAGA influencers are screaming cover-up.

Influential talk show host Tucker Carlson took this to another level by launching a tirade over it. He went a step further and faulted the Trump administration for failing to take MAGA's questions about the situation seriously.

For many, this wasn't politics. It was a betrayal, a red line crossed with a smirk.

""Punch in the gut,"" said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. ""It is a red line for many people."" She warned of ""significant"" blowback inside the movement. House Speaker Mike Johnson, always cautious, publicly broke ranks on Tuesday. ""The Attorney General needs to explain this,"" he said on Capitol Hill. ""The public deserves answers.""

Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, who serves on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, was less diplomatic. ""AG Bondi needs to stop stonewalling and communicate with us,"" she said.

In February, US Attorney General Pam Bondi had promised to release the files, saying she had a ""client list on my desk"".

At the Turning Point USA summit (one of the biggest gatherings of young American conservatives) in Tampa on July 13, the air was thick with sweat and rebellion, and Epstein fire eclipsed every other talking point.

Steve Bannon paced the stage like an oracle betrayed, calling the case ""the key that picks the lock on institutional corruption."" He warned Trump could lose ""ten percent of the movement"" over this.

Dan Bongino, Deputy Director of the FBI, reportedly offered to resign after the memo dropped. Michael Flynn, ex-Trump insider, called it ""another brutal and stark example of the two standards in America.""

But it was Megyn Kelly, another star on the far-right firmament, who cut deepest: ""Either Pam Bondi was telling the truth then, or she’s telling the truth now. But both cannot be true.""

Calls for the release of Epstein-related files are now mostly coming from within Trump's core base, not just political opponents.

Noted Republicans like Rep. Lauren Boebert want a special counsel. Rep. Chip Roy says, ""We want to see more information."" Sen. John Kennedy asked what many are wondering aloud: ""Who did Epstein traffic those women to, and why weren’t they prosecuted?""

These are not fringe voices. This is the engine room of the MAGA train.

Trump has framed the Epstein episode as another left-wing distraction. He claimed that outrage over the Justice Department’s decision not to release additional information and close the investigation was just the latest ""scam"" cooked up by Democrats.

Online, the fury is volcanic. Elon Musk, once a Trump defender, cast aspersions on the issue. Far right notables like Jack Posobiec called for a ""Jan. 6-style committee"" to investigate the Epstein files. Laura Loomer said Bondi should be fired, not shuffled, not protected, but gone.

The backlash stems from a simple sequence: The truth on Epstein was promised. Bondi flashed a binder. Bongino teased bombshells. Kash Patel, the FBI Director, previously hinted at an Epstein ‘black book’ of contacts. Then — silence. A July memo. No list. No names.

Jeffrey Epstein, a financier with ties to global elites, was arrested in 2019 for sex trafficking and found dead weeks later in a New York jail, ruled a suicide. Ghislaine Maxwell, his associate, was later jailed for helping him abuse minors. The case has always animated Trump's base.

The President is now saying the Epstein files are a hoax.

But in a movement built on belief — on the sacred idea that corruption hides in plain sight, and only Trump had the courage to expose it — this isn’t just a tactical misstep. It appears like a rupture in the story.Behind the scenes, Trump's 2026 strategy team has shown signs of anxiety. Liz Wheeler, American conservative political commentator, warned, bluntly: ""This issue could cost him the midterms.""

And the chorus grows. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, a major name in MAGA, noted, ""What happens next, so I think, is gonna be really important. It’s gonna differentiate whether or not this is just a moment or a lasting multi-generational movement.""

And yet, through it all, the base keeps coming back to the same question. What happened in that jail cell? Who flew on those planes? What names are missing?And as the smoke rises, one voice cuts through, ""We all deserve to know what's in the Epstein files,"" said Rep. Thomas Massie. ""Who's implicated. How deep this corruption goes. Americans were promised justice and transparency.""

The MAGA base is still waiting."

The accords were finalised on Wednesday in the presence of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following a high-level meeting between the two leaders and the inaugural session of the Türkiye–UAE High-Level Strategic Council.

Welcoming Mohammed bin Zayed and his delegation, Erdogan described the visit as a continuation of the momentum established during his own trip to Abu Dhabi in 2023.

“We laid the foundation of our strategic partnership then — and today, it’s producing concrete results across almost every field,” Erdogan said.

Expanding trade, deepening ties

Highlighting the rapid growth in economic relations, Erdogan noted the dramatic rise in trade volume: “Only a few years ago, we questioned whether $10 billion in trade was attainable. Now, we aim to exceed $20 billion this year and reach $40 billion in the medium term.”

The agreements span a wide range of sectors, including defence, investment, technology, energy, tourism, and food security. Notably, an MoU was signed on mutual investment cooperation in tourism and hospitality, while additional deals focus on pharmaceuticals, industrial production, agriculture, and food sectors.

Defence cooperation was also formalised with an agreement on the mutual protection of classified information.

The two sides signed a memorandum to establish a joint consular committee and launched a unique pact on collaboration in polar research, underscoring their ambitions in scientific and technological development.

Erdogan said the leaders also discussed pressing regional issues, with particular attention to the ongoing crisis in Gaza.

“Our cooperation isn’t just economic — it’s built on mutual understanding in addressing regional challenges,” he added.

The visit marks another chapter in the evolving partnership between Ankara and Abu Dhabi, turning what was once a cautious diplomatic relationship into one of the region’s most dynamic partnerships."

""In the next few hours, we hope to see some real progress.""

Rubio said the United States was concerned, adding that he had just spoken to the relevant parties over the phone.

""We're going to be working on that issue as we speak. I just got off the phone with the relevant parties. We're very concerned about it, and hopefully we'll have some updates later today. But we're very concerned about it,"" Rubio added.

Israel killed at least one person and wounded 18 others in its fresh air strikes on the Syrian capital, Damascus.

The state news agency SANA said on Wednesday that warplanes carried out strikes on the General Staff Complex and the Presidential Palace, known as Qasr al-Shaab, in the capital.

Israel's Army Radio confirmed the strike near the Presidential Palace in Damascus.

Videos circulating on social media showed the moments of Israeli attacks in Damascus, with smoke rising from the area.

Israel moving some troops from Gaza to Syria frontiers

Witnesses told the AFP news agency they heard an explosion in the area of the palace, a high-security compound which is located on a hill overlooking the capital and is where President Ahmed al Sharaa receives visitors.

A 51-year-old Damascus resident, requesting anonymity due to the security situation, said she was on her balcony trying to see the aftermath of the strikes near the army headquarters when she ""heard an explosion and saw smoke rising near the presidential palace"".

The attacks came shortly after Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened Damascus with ""painful blows.""

The Israeli army has been bombarding Syria since Tuesday, particularly in Sweida, in the latest violation of the country's sovereignty on false claims of protecting the Druze in Syria.

The attacks came as the Syrian army deployed forces in the province to restore security and protect civilians and their property, following clashes between armed Druze and Bedouin groups that left at least 30 people dead.

Meanwhile, an Israeli military official said on Wednesday that some troops stationed in besieged Gaza were to be redeployed to the area of the frontier with Syria, in an apparent move to destabilise its neighbour."

Speaking at a press conference in Yerevan on Wednesday, Pashinyan described recent talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as “open and sincere,” adding that the agenda moved beyond traditional normalisation efforts to include state-to-state ties.

“All issues were discussed – from the opening of communications to the restoration of the historical Ani bridge,” Pashinyan said, according to state-run Armenpress.

He acknowledged that no concrete agreements were reached but emphasised a long-term outlook. “Such complex and deep issues cannot be resolved with a single action. We need to build trust and prepare the public.”

He added: “I have no doubt that we will reach that point: diplomatic relations will be established, and the border will be opened.”

Return to CSTO unlikely

Pashinyan reiterated that Armenia is unlikely to resume its participation in the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), citing the bloc’s failure to support Armenia in times of need.

“We froze our participation due to the CSTO’s failure to fulfil its obligations,” he said, referring to Yerevan’s decision earlier this year to suspend attendance at CSTO events and halt payments. “At this point, leaving seems more likely than returning.”

Separately, during a meeting in Brussels, Pashinyan made Armenia’s European ambitions explicit.

“Yes, Armenia wants to become a member of the European Union,” he said. “Regardless of the final outcome, we will continue reforms aligned with European standards.”

He reaffirmed his commitment to the EU-Armenia Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement, describing it as a key platform for reform and modernisation."

According to official figures, approved export licenses amounted to $189 million (€161.1 million) in 2024 and $33 million (€28 million) in the first quarter of 2025.

The government released these figures in response to a parliamentary inquiry from the opposition Left Party, which calls for an immediate end to arms exports to Israel.

Germany has long been a staunch supporter of Israel, with political leaders repeatedly citing the country's historical responsibility toward Israel, rooted in Germany's Nazi past and the Holocaust.

Weapons exports to Israel were briefly suspended last year when Nicaragua filed a case against Germany at the International Court of Justice, accusing Germany of complicity in genocide in Gaza.

German officials later resumed exports, arguing that they received written assurances from Israel about compliance with international law. They also cited the threat posed by Iran as another justification for resuming arms shipments.

Since Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza in 2023, more than 58,000 Palestinians have been killed, and over 100,000 others wounded, most of them women and children.

Israel currently faces a genocide case at the ICJ for its actions in Gaza, where at least 1.9 million Palestinians remain displaced and suffer from severe shortages of food, medical supplies, and other essentials."

Then the applause.

One by one, employees stepped out of the State Department's C Street headquarters, some in silence, others teary-eyed, as a crowd gathered to bear witness.

More than 1,350 US State Department employees were laid off on July 11 in one of the largest diplomatic workforce cuts in US history, sparking warnings of long-term effects to American influence.

""The rationale being offered is that this (position eliminations) 'streamlines decision-making' and 'empowers embassies,'"" Rachel Williams, DC-based foreign policy expert, told TRT World.

""The layoffs have shaken Washington's diplomatic establishment. There is worry here that this will cost the US influence in the places that need it most,"" she added.

The firings marked one of the most significant single-day workforce reductions in the department's modern history.

According to an internal memo circulated by the Bureau of Global Talent Management, the layoffs affected 1,107 civil service employees and 246 members of the Foreign Service, all stationed in the United States.

""This is not a consequence of trying to get rid of people,"" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said during a press appearance over the weekend. ""But if you close the bureau, you don't need those positions. Understand that some of these are positions that are being eliminated, not people.""

For those being walked out, that distinction felt thin.

Michael Duffin, a senior policy adviser at the Bureau of Counterterrorism, stood at the protest, where a cardboard sign said: Diplomacy matters. Feds matter. His team — the Office of Countering Violent Extremism — had been dissolved earlier that morning.

""No one at the State Department would disagree with the need for reform,"" Duffin said at the rally. ""But arbitrarily laying off people like me and others, irrespective of their performance, is not the right way to do it.""

Williams said she personally knows several people who were recently let go. ""These are capable, principled public servants. Career diplomats, subject-matter experts — people who have spent decades serving administrations of both (Republican and Democratic) parties.""

American Foreign Service Association estimates that at least 20 percent of the Foreign Service workforce has already been lost this year. It attributes the cuts to ""the shuttering of institutions and forced resignations.""

Earlier this year, the State Department notified Congress of its intent to reduce its US-based workforce by 18 percent through a combination of voluntary departures and terminations.

That target now appears well within reach.

""The Department is streamlining domestic operations to focus on diplomatic priorities,"" said an internal State Department notice that was sent to the workforce.

""Headcount reductions have been carefully tailored to affect non-core functions, duplicative or redundant offices, and offices where considerable efficiencies may be found,"" it added.

Laid-off civil servants and Foreign Service officers leave the State Department in Washington after more than 1,300 jobs were slashed, in a sweeping restructuring.

Impact on US global standing

Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress have raised concerns over the firings, calling the move a serious threat to the US' global standing.

""While there are targeted reforms that our government can pursue to maximise the impact of every tax dollar, that's not what this is,"" a group of Democratic senators wrote in a strongly worded letter opposing the changes.

""Blanket and indiscriminate cuts — the legacy from Elon Musk’s failed DOGE effort —weaken our government’s ability to deliver for the American people in a cost-effective manner.""

“Among the most affected offices are those focused on soft power: public diplomacy, human rights, and counter-disinformation. These teams tend to handle long-term influence-building and values-based engagement, particularly in contested spaces where China and Russia are aggressively shaping narratives,"" Williams said.

""This isn't just internal trimming,"" she added. ""There's a belief in this administration that diplomacy can be done by fewer people, faster, with less oversight.""

Stephen Farnsworth, professor of political science at the University of Mary Washington, echoes Williams' perspective.""President Trump has long had his doubts about the federal bureaucracy, where there are rules and procedures that limit what Trump wants to do,"" he told TRT World.

Earlier this month, the US Agency for International Development officially shut down, following an executive order from President Trump. By March, more than 80 percent of the agency's programmes had already been cancelled. The remaining staff and projects were absorbed into the State Department on July 1.The layoffs are part of a wider restructuring effort by the Trump administration.

""Trump believes that he is America's best diplomat,"" Farnsworth added. ""And feels he doesn't need a big State Department staff.""

For many inside Foggy Bottom, the question now is not whether they agree with the reforms, but whether they'll survive them.

At a press briefing, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce acknowledged the human cost.

""It's sometimes difficult, as any enterprise in America has learned, that when change is necessary, but in this case, we've inherited a dynamic that needed reform, and we are taking and implementing reform,"" she said."

Rutte commented while meeting with senators in the US Congress the day after President Donald Trump announced new weapons for Ukraine and threatened ""biting"" secondary tariffs of 100 percent on the buyers of Russian exports unless there is a peace deal in 50 days.

""My encouragement to these three countries, particularly, is, if you live now in Beijing, or Delhi, or you are the president of Brazil, you might want to take a look into this, because this might hit you very hard,"" Rutte told reporters, who met with Trump on Monday and agreed the new steps.

""So please make the phone call to Vladimir Putin and tell him that he has to get serious about peace talks, because otherwise this will slam back on Brazil, on India and China in a massive way,"" Rutte added.

Republican US Senator Thom Tillis praised Trump for announcing the steps, but said the 50-day delay ""worries"" him.

He said he was concerned that ""Putin would try to use the 50 days to win the war, or to be better positioned to negotiate a peace agreement after having murdered and potentially collected more ground as a basis for negotiation.”

""So we should look at the current state of Ukraine today and say, no matter what you do over the next 50 days, any of your gains are off the table,"" he added.

Rutte said Europe would find the money to ensure Ukraine was in the best possible position in peace talks.

He said that under the agreement with Trump, the US would now ""massively"" supply Ukraine with weapons, not just air defence, but also missiles, also ammunition paid for by the Europeans.""

Asked if long-range missiles for Ukraine were under discussion, Rutte said: ""It is both defensive and offensive.

His comments on Tuesday came after The Financial Times, citing people briefed on discussions, reported that Trump had privately encouraged Ukraine to step up deep strikes on Russia.

The newspaper added that Trump asked Zelenskyy whether he could strike Moscow if the US provided long-range weapons.

On Monday, Trump announced more weapons for Kiev and a toughened stance against Russia for its military offensive in Ukraine.

Trump has given Kremlin 50 days to end the fighting or face massive new economic sanctions.

With NATO chief Mark Rutte, Trump also unveiled a deal under which European members of the alliance would buy billions of dollars of arms from the United States — including Patriot anti-missile batteries — and send them to Ukraine.

Trump has long railed against what he sees as the outsized role the United States has played in arming Ukraine, even though NATO says Europe is now responsible for the bulk of the weaponry going to Kiev.

European nations Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands have already said they will or are looking to participate in the new US scheme.

US should share 'burden' of arming Ukraine

EU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas however said the US should ""share the burden"" of arming Ukraine.

""We welcome President Trump's announcement to send more weapons to Ukraine, although we would like to see US share the burden,"" Kallas said after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels.

""If you promise to give the weapons, but say that it's somebody else who is going to pay for it, it is not really given by you.""

On Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Ukraine will most likely perceive a decision by the US, NATO and EU about military supplies ""as encouragement to continue the war.""

Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Peskov said statements by Europe's political leadership suggest it favours escalating hostilities versus pursuing peace.

Russia remains open to direct negotiations with Ukraine and continues to wait for proposals on dates for a third round of talks, said Peskov.

""We're ready but have received no proposals from Kiev. While Washington and Europe claim to want dialogue, their actions suggest otherwise,"" he noted."

During the hearing, Waltz said he will veto “anti-Israel” resolutions at the United Nations Security Council.

Waltz made the commitment in response to a question by Senator John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, who said ""the Palestinian Authority has repeatedly sought to use the United Nations as a platform to declare statehood.""

Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Palestinian Authority, has repeatedly called for full UN membership for Palestine.

Its admission as the 194th member of the United Nations would require approval by all five veto-wielding members of the UN Security Council including the United States.

Waltz’s hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee provides senators with the first opportunity to grill Waltz over revelations in March that he added The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on an unclassified messaging app that was used to discuss planning for strikes on Houthis in Yemen.

Waltz has spent the last few months on the White House payroll despite being removed as national security adviser.

He said he and Coons ""have a fundamental disagreement"" about concerns over the situation.

All elements of the package had been agreed, although one member state still had a reservation about a proposed lower price cap on Russian oil, according to sources on Monday.

The European Commission last month proposed the 18th package of sanctions against Russia for its war with Ukraine, aimed at Moscow's energy revenue, its banks, and its military industry.

The new package proposes banning transactions with Russia's Nord Stream gas pipelines, as well as banks that engage in sanctions circumvention.

It also proposes a floating price cap on Russian oil of 15 percent below the average market price of crude in the previous three months, EU diplomats have said.

7/15/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/aa10b04aaa78,Superman returns with a story that looks a lot like GazaJames Gunn’s latest Superman film has ignited fierce debate over whether it serves as an allegory for the Israel-Gaza war or just about the US immigration policy.,"James Gunn’s new Superman film has just arrived in cinemas and it begins with a striking scene in which a technologically advanced military targets innocent civilians across a heavily guarded border fence.

If this scenario brings to mind Israel’s attacks on Gaza, you are not alone.

Social media has been quick to frame the film as a pointed criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza.

A five-star review on Letterboxd described it as “very anti-Israel”, a sentiment that has drawn nearly nine million views.

Another post, seen by 11 million users on X, claims the film’s critique is “very explicit and in your face.”

On X, one user wrote, “Y’all were not kidding about how anti-Israel and pro-Palestine that Superman movie was, and they were not slick with it AT ALL.”

Another commented, “Superman was so openly anti-Israel, and god, it was so good.” A third user added, “Not going to lie, I really like the anti-Israel sentiment from Superman, and now I know James Gunn is always standing on business.”

Controversy over the film’s message has been building since Gunn told The Times that the story is “about politics” and “morality,” and that Superman’s journey is, in essence, “an immigrant” story. This led to heavy criticism, especially from people who support President Donald Trump’s strict anti-immigration policies.

Neither Gunn nor the cast have explicitly stated that the story is about Israel or Palestine, yet early audiences have homed in on one of the film’s central plotlines as an allegory for the current war.

But does the film really focus on Israel and Palestine? Whether the comparison is justified is open to interpretation. The following includes minor spoilers.

The film introduces us to a conflict between two fictional nations, Boravia and Jarhanpur that has drawn immediate comparisons to the situation in Gaza.

The narrative opens three weeks after Superman (David Corenswet) has intervened to prevent Boravia, a US ally, from invading its poorer neighbour, Jarhanpur. Boravia possesses a powerful, US-backed military, while Jarhanpur is depicted as defenceless and impoverished.

Early on, Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan), a journalist, interviews Superman about his intervention in Boravia .

“The secretary of defence says that he’s going to look into your actions,” Lois says. Superman responds, “My actions? I stopped a war.”

Boravian forces appear with tanks and heavy weaponry while civilians from Jarhanpur are left fleeing with nothing to protect them. The visual language is familiar with arid terrain, modest clothing, and civilians met with rifles as they approach a border fence.

While this power imbalance has existed in other real-life wars, there is a particular detail that leads many to see a closer connection to Israel and Palestine.

The Boravians are depicted as ethnically white, while the people of Jarhanpur are not.

Boravia’s campaign is also shown as a settler-colonial effort to displace Jarhanpur’s indigenous population and expand its own territory.

At one point, experimental weapons are deployed against civilians.

In another scene, Jarhanpurians walk towards the border holding sticks and stones while soldiers from Boravia aim rifles at them from the other side of a metal fence. A boy waves a Superman flag in the hope that he will be saved as the soldiers move closer.

For some, these comparisons are too pointed to ignore.

The discussions between characters also mirror familiar arguments in the Israel-Palestine debate.

Lois Lane defends genocidal regime Boravia’s position by saying that a stronger Jarhanpurian government could be a future threat, an argument often used against Hamas.

The film depicts Superman as the sole survivor of a genocide that wiped out both his family and his entire civilisation. This experience allows him to recognise the true nature of the new regime committing similar atrocities.

Superman and anyone who dares to challenge the billionaire or the regime accused of mass violence are locked away in cramped, degrading detention centres that strongly resemble those run by ICE in the real world.

The people held inside are stripped of their humanity in both language and treatment, making it easier for those in power to keep them imprisoned indefinitely, without any clear end.

This reality also demonstrates the way Palestinians are treated brutally by Israel and detained without their basic human rights.

From fighting the Klan to witnessing occupation

It is no surprise that James Gunn’s new film draws clear lines between superhero storytelling and contemporary injustice.

Superman’s history as a character has always been bound up with confronting oppression, from fighting the KKK to taking on Nazis.

But in this iteration, Superman’s enemies use modern tools of propaganda.

One of the film’s boldest moves is its depiction of how the billionaire villain and the regime wield online manipulation to undermine Superman’s reputation.

They deploy troll farms, literally run by monkeys in the story, to attack Superman across social media. The campaign uses Islamophobic slurs, accusing Superman of keeping a ""harem"" of women in a supposed plot to dominate the world.

These wild accusations reflect Israel’s propaganda after October 7, where those in power often accuse their enemies of exactly the wrongdoings they themselves commit.

As the film shows, villains – resembling figures such as Musk and Trump – seek personal gain and behave with hypocrisy, all while painting Superman as the threat.

The film keeps the Boravia-Jarhanpur conflict in focus, with Boravian leader Vasil Glarkos, played by Zlatko Buric, an old white bloodthirsty politician resembling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

He openly states his intention to steal the land, take its oil and gas, hand parts of it to wealthy elites, and sell off the rest to whoever will pay the most.

Vasil also works alongside the main antagonist, Lex Luthor, played by Nicholas Hoult. Lex is portrayed as playing a central role in Boravia’s aggression and seeks to seize part of Jarhanpur for himself.

The other political undertones include such as Lex Luthor being modelled after Donald Trump.

“Of course, Donald Trump was our model,” Superman writer John Byrne told the Daily Beast in 2016. DC Comics later published an “unauthorised Lex Luthor biography” that closely resembled the cover of Trump’s book, The Art of the Deal.

Writing in real timeThe film’s timeline also lines up with real-world events. Gunn began writing shortly after October 7, 2023, and finished the script by December. Filming began at the end of February 2024.

During this time, Gunn commented on the war indirectly. Egyptian comedian Bassem Youssef announced that he lost a role in the film after making comments about Gaza, although Gunn later clarified that Youssef had never been formally offered a part, though they had spoken about the possibility.

Gunn wrote on Threads that there was no dispute between them and that they had cleared up any misunderstanding through conversation.

While the director has kept quiet about any real-life parallels, both Boravia and Jarhanpur have appeared in the comics for years, making it difficult to ignore the similarities to Israel and Palestine."

Lavrov, speaking at a press conference at the 25th Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Foreign Ministers meeting in the Chinese city of Tianjin on Tuesday, said he had no doubt that Russia would cope with any new sanctions.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, on the other hand, said on Tuesday that Moscow views diplomacy as the preferred path to resolve the Ukraine conflict and remains open to negotiations.

Commenting on US President Donald Trump's recent remarks in an interview with the Russian state news agency TASS, Ryabkov emphasised that Russia rejects ultimatums.

""Naturally, we note first and foremost that any attempts to issue demands, especially ultimatums, are unacceptable to us,"" the diplomat said.

‘This position is unshakable’

He called for intensified political and diplomatic efforts, reiterating President Vladimir Putin’s stance that Russia is prepared for talks and favours a diplomatic resolution.

However, Ryabkov warned that without progress in negotiations, Moscow ""will continue pursuing its objectives through the special military operation"" if its willingness to engage diplomatically goes unanswered.

""This position is unshakable. We would like Washington and NATO in general to treat it with the utmost seriousness,"" he stressed.

Ryabkov noted that Trump’s latest statements ""generally fit into the pattern that we have been seeing from the American side lately.""

On Monday, Trump announced continued US weapons transfers to Kiev conditioned on European funding, with NATO coordinating the process.

He also threatened 100 percent import tariffs on Russia and its trade partners in the absence of a Ukraine settlement within 50 days."

“To all units operating within Suwayda city, we announce a complete ceasefire following an agreement with the city’s elders and dignitaries,” he said on X.

However, he specified that Syrian forces would respond only to direct attacks or sources of gunfire from “outlaw groups.”

The minister unveiled plans to hand over neighbourhoods in Suwayda city to the internal security forces “as soon as clearance operations are completed to restore order, enable residents to return to their homes, and reestablish stability in the city.”

Abu Qasra also stated that military police units have been deployed within Suwayda to monitor military conduct and hold violators accountable.

In parallel, the Syrian army has begun withdrawing heavy military equipment from Suwayda, preparing for the handover of the city’s neighbourhoods to internal security forces responsible for maintaining law and order, according to the state news agency SANA.

On Tuesday morning, the spiritual leadership of the Druze community in Syria urged all armed factions in Suwayda to cooperate fully with government security forces and surrender their weapons.

Earlier, Ahmed al Dalati, head of internal security in Suwayda, announced a curfew in the city, effective Tuesday morning “until further notice.”

On Monday, more than 30 people were killed and nearly 100 others wounded in clashes between armed Bedouin tribal fighters and Druze militias in Suwayda.

Bashar al Assad, Syria’s dictator for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia in December, ending the Baath Party regime, which had been in power since 1963.

The fresh round of punishment over the war on Ukraine has been held up for weeks by a wrangle with Slovakia over separate plans to phase out Russian gas imports and resistance from Malta over the price cap.

""We are hoping that it's either today or tomorrow that we adopt the 18th package of sanctions,"" Kallas said ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels.

""So I hope it's today, but it's still some work to do.""

Slovakia's Russia-friendly leader Robert Fico has signalled he could drop his opposition after talks with Brussels over its plans to cut off Russian gas imports by the end of 2027.

Officials said the bloc is also close to agreeing a plan to lower its price cap on Russian oil exported to third countries around the world.

""It's alive,"" Kallas told journalists.

That comes despite EU allies failing to convince US President Donald Trump to go along with the plan.

The cap is a G7 initiative aimed at limiting the amount of money Russia makes by exporting oil to countries across the world.

The oil price cap, set at $60 by the G7 in 2022, is designed to limit the price Moscow can sell oil around the world by banning shipping firms and insurance companies dealing with Russia to export above that amount.

Under the new EU scheme - which would likely also have the backing of G7 allies like Britain and Canada - the bloc would set a new flexible rate below market value.

That would currently equate to $47.6, according to internal EU discussions shared with AFP.

Diplomats admit that the fact the United States is not on board with the move, will make it less effective.

""Even if the Americans are not aboard, but the other G7 countries are on board, then we will move on with this,"" Kallas said.

As part of its sanctions, the EU is also planning to target scores more vessels in the ""shadow fleet"" of ageing tankers used by Russia to circumvent oil export curbs.

The new measures from the EU come as Trump has taken a tougher line with Russia, threatening to impose major ""secondary tariffs"" if Moscow doesn't agree to a halt fighting in 50 days."
7/15/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/1f09c349368f,US nuclear commission job post includes political loyalty questionsCritics say questions amount to litmus test as Trump seeks to speed nuclear power plant approvals,"A job notice posted by the US nuclear power regulator asks applicants political questions as the administration of President Donald Trump seeks to increase influence over an independent agency.

The posting, seen by Reuters on Monday, asks applicants how their commitment to the US Constitution and founding US principles inspired them to pursue the job. The specific opening is for a senior operations engineer serving as an inspector in the division of operating reactor safety at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Also among the questions asked are how applicants would use their experience to improve government efficiency and effectiveness, and, ""How would you advance the President's Executive Orders and policy priorities in this role?""

Trump has been trying to speed NRC approvals of nuclear power plants as the United States faces the first hike in power demand in 20 years, driven by the boom in artificial intelligence and data centres.

The Republican president signed executive orders in May seeking to overhaul the NRC and directing the agency, which was founded as a regulator independent of the executive branch, to rule on new licenses within 18 months.

Scott Burnell, an NRC spokesperson, said on Monday that the agency was ""following Office of Personnel Management requirements regarding job postings,"" referring to the US government's human resources agency.

Under previous US administrations, questions in NRC job postings typically emphasised the applicant's work experience pertaining to operating a nuclear reactor, not an applicant's political opinions, said a person who works at the agency who requested anonymity.

In addition, a former chairman of the NRC told Reuters on Monday that the questions on the posting amount to a political litmus test.

""If I saw something like this as Chairman, I would tell the staff to replace them immediately with relevant professional questions, not something that reads like a lost chapter from 'Animal Farm' on how to destroy professional expertise in government,"" said Greg Jaczko, who served as NRC chairman from 2009 to 2012 under former President Barack Obama. Jaczko was referring to George Orwell's 1945 satirical novel.

In the current job posting at issue, not all of the six questions were related to politics. One, for example, asks how work ethics have contributed to the applicant's achievements, another asks them to confirm that they did not use AI in their responses.

Trump last month fired Chris Hanson, a Democratic NRC commissioner, a move that was criticized by nearly 30 former NRC officials and employees.

David Wright, the current NRC chair, told a Senate committee last week that a representative from Trump's Department of Government Efficiency is working within the NRC on reforming the agency."

Degel HaTorah, part of the United Torah Judaism (UTJ) alliance, announced its resignation after top rabbis instructed lawmakers to quit the government on Monday.

Hours later, Agudat Yisrael — the Hasidic faction of UTJ — also said it would leave the coalition.

The decision threatens Netanyahu’s parliamentary majority and deepens the political crisis surrounding military conscription, a long-running point of contention between religious and secular segments of Israeli society.

""The state authorities are clearly showing their intention to increase pressure on Torah scholars, with repeated attempts to degrade and trample them,"" wrote Rabbi Dov Landau, a leading Haredi figure who ordered Degel HaTorah to resign.

""Time and again, they fail to uphold their commitments.""

Although the withdrawals do not immediately collapse Netanyahu’s government, they significantly weaken it.

The Likud-led coalition held 67 of the Knesset’s 120 seats prior to the announcements.

Without ultra-Orthodox support, the government would lack a working majority.

The exemption bill — aimed at formalising legal protections for ultra-Orthodox students who refuse compulsory military service — has been at the centre of weeks of political tension.

Talks to finalise a draft version had reportedly stalled, despite Netanyahu’s efforts to reach a compromise.

Degel HaTorah officials said they would return to the government only if Netanyahu presented a draft acceptable to senior rabbis."

""It's been proven over the years. He's fooled a lot of people…. He fooled [Bill] Clinton, [George] Bush, [Barrack] Obama, [Joe] Biden. He didn't fool me,"" Trump said on Monday during an Oval office meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte as he laid out plans for new infusions of weaponry for Kiev via NATO.

""But what I do say is that at a certain point, you know, ultimately talk doesn't talk. It's got to be action. It's got to be results and I hope he does it. It's potentially such a great country to be wasting so many people on…""

Trump demanded that Russia end its Ukraine war within 50 days or face massive new economic sanctions while blaming former US President Biden for the war.

""It wasn't my war, it was Biden's war. It's not my war. I'm trying to get you out of it and we want to see it end,” Trump said, adding ""This is a Democrat war, not a Republican or Trump war. This is a war that would have never happened. It shouldn't have happened.""

He said he was ""disappointed"" with President Putin ""because I thought we would have had a deal two months ago, but it doesn't seem to get there. So based on that, we're going to be doing secondary tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days.""

During their talks, Trump and Rutte also unveiled a deal under which the NATO military alliance would buy billions of dollars of arms from the United States — including Patriot anti-missile batteries — and then send them to Ukraine.

""This is really big,"" said Rutte, as he touted a deal aimed at easing Trump's long-held complaints that the US is paying more than European and NATO allies to aid Ukraine.

Germany, Canada, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Britain were among the buyers helping Ukraine, added the NATO chief.

Pivot toward Putin and U-turn

Trump attempted a rapprochement with Putin shortly after starting his second term, in a bid to honour his election campaign pledge to end the Ukraine war within 24 hours.

His pivot toward Putin sparked fears in Kiev that he was about to sell out Ukraine, especially after Trump and his team berated Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on February 28.

But in recent weeks Trump has shown increasing frustration with Putin as the Russian leader, instead of halting his military offensive, stepped up missile and drone attacks to record levels.

Kiev too has upped its attacks on Russian mainland and in the areas controlled by Moscow.

Trump said his wife Melania had helped changed his thinking about Putin, a man for whom he formerly expressed admiration.

""I go home, I tell the First Lady, 'you know, I spoke to Vladimir today, we had a wonderful conversation.',"" Trump said. ""And she said, 'Oh really? Another city was just hit.'"" He added of Putin: ""I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy.""

Meanwhile, US House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries blasted Trump over his Ukraine policy, accusing him of undermining American interests by aligning himself closely with Putin.

""Vladimir Putin has spent the entire year punking Donald Trump and the Trump administration,"" Jeffries told the reporters at the Capitol Hill.

Jeffires said Trump made promises to the American people, yet he continues to break those promises, including his pledge to bring peace to Ukraine.

""Donald Trump has spent the first six months of his presidency playing footsie with Vladimir Putin, and the response from Vladimir Putin, a sworn enemy of the United States of America, has been to unleash terror on Ukrainian children, communities and civilians.

""Donald Trump has zero credibility in this area. Is he just now figuring out that Ukraine is a friend to the United States of America and Russia is an enemy?"" Jeffries said.

He said the Congress has to act independently in this area.

""We should sanction Russia and continue to keep the pressure on Vladimir Putin and Russia, a sworn enemy of this country, until the Ukrainian people are able to achieve victory for themselves, our NATO allies in Europe and the free world,"" he added."
7/14/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/7c1eb2ae23ec,"Following 'Bondi-Bongino clash', MAGA activist warns Epstein files could harm Republicans in midtermDecision to withhold records from Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation causes discontent among influential figures in far-right American media and supporters of Donald Trump.","As US President Donald Trump attempts to quell the controversy surrounding the Justice Department's handling of the investigation into the death of convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein and his alleged clientele, his conservative supporters are warning that the issue could affect Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections.

""We have the midterm elections coming up, and I agree that we can't allow for one issue to dominate the entire news cycle and take up everybody’s energy,"" Laura Loomer, the MAGA [Make America Great Again] activist who is influential in Trump's inner circle, told the POLITICO, a US political newspaper.

""We have to focus on the economy, we have to focus on immigration, we have to focus on a lot of issues. A lot of people need to learn how to walk and chew gum at the same time. President Trump, as the leader of the free world and the most powerful man in the world, can’t allow for his entire administration to be fully consumed with a single issue.""

The Justice Department and FBI, under the Trump administration, are working to manage the repercussions following last week's decision to withhold records from the Epstein sex trafficking investigation.

This decision has caused discontent among influential figures in the far-right media and supporters of Trump.

The move, which included the acknowledgment that one particular sought-after document never actually existed, sparked a contentious conversation between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino at the White House this week, the Associated Press reported.

""The spat threatened to shatter relations between them and centered in part on a news story that described divisions between the FBI and the Justice Department,"" the AP said.

Part of the clash centered on a story from the news organisation NewsNation that cited a ""source close to the White House"" as saying the FBI would have released the Epstein files months ago if it could have done so on its own. The story included statements from Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and FBI Director Kash Patel refuting the premise, but not Bongino.

The cascade of disappointment and disbelief arising from the refusal to disclose additional, much-hyped records from the Epstein investigation underscores the struggles of FBI and Justice Department leaders to resolve the conspiracy theories and amped-up expectations that they themselves had stoked with claims of a cover-up and hidden evidence.

Infuriated by the failure of officials to unlock, as promised, the secrets of the so-called ""deep state,"", Trump supporters on the far right have grown restless and even demanded change at the top.

Trump expressed frustration in a social media posting on Saturday over the divide among diehards of his MAGA movement over the matter, and expressed support for Bondi. His lengthy post made no mention of Bongino.

""What's going on with my 'boys' and, in some cases, 'gals?'"" Trump wrote. ""They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what’s happening.""

Tensions that simmered for months boiled over last week when the Justice Department and FBI issued a two-page statement saying that they had concluded that Epstein did not possess a ""client list.""

The acknowledgment that the well-connected Epstein did not have a list of clients to whom underage girls were trafficked represents a public walk-back of a theory that the Trump administration had helped promote, with Bondi suggesting in a Fox News interview earlier this year that such a document was ""sitting on my desk"" for review.

The department did disclose a video meant to prove that Epstein killed himself in jail, but even that raised the eyebrows of conspiracy theorists because of a missing minute in the recording.

Trump has labelled his administration ""the talk of the world"" and warned against ""selfish people"" trying to damage its image.

He denounced the revival of interest in case involving the late financier and convicted sex offender Epstein, calling related documents ""Files written by (former US President Barack) Obama, Crooked (former Secretary of State) Hillary (Clinton), (former FBI Director James) Comey, (former CIA head John) Brennan, and the losers and criminals of the Biden Administration.""

""The Epstein Files"" were, according to Trump, manufactured similarly to the ""fake"" Steele dossier, a controversial opposition report by counterintelligence agent Christopher Steele.

""If there was anything in there that could have hurt the MAGA Movement, why didn't they use it?"" he asked.

Photographs of Trump and Epstein together have been publicly available for a considerable time; however, Trump has stated that he was unaware of Epstein's offences which included procuring a minor for prostitution and sex trafficking.

The Epstein issue has caused a significant divide amongst Trump's supporters, marking one of the largest rifts since his second term began.

MAGA supporters allege Epstein was murdered and kept a client list. However, the DOJ and FBI have found no evidence to support these claims.

""I don't think that just putting out a Truth Social post is going to make this issue go away. It's kind of had a Streisand effect, actually, where people are focusing on this topic a lot more than they were before he posted a Truth Social,"" Loomer told POLITICO.

""I think that it would be wise for the White House to develop some type of a strategy in addressing the base's concerns, so that we can mitigate any fallout or damage done to the Trump administration.""

On Monday morning, the conservative influencer Benny Johnson outlined a four-pronged approach for Trump to address what he termed ""the Epstein memo crisis"".

This included calling for a press conference and bringing in former President Bill Clinton for questioning.

Midterm elections to the US Congress are a referendums on the performance of the president's party, with voters punishing or rewarding the party based on key issues.

Since the end of WW2, it has been common for the presidential party to lose seats in midterm elections, although this loss is more consistent in the House of Representatives than in the Senate.

Former White House aide Steve Bannon suggested last week that the Republican Party could lose dozens of House seats in the 2026 midterms over the Trump administration's handling of files related to disgraced financier Epstein.

""You're going to lose 10 percent of the MAGA movement. If we lose 10 percent of the MAGA movement right now, we ain't gonna … we're gonna lose 40 seats in '26,"" he cautioned during his ""War Room"" podcast. ""We are gonna lose the president.""

Trisha Hope, a former staunch Trump supporter, expressed her frustration in a recent post on X.

""President Trump's lack of concern for the Epstein victims and his callus response to the reporter's question, ends my relationship with him. I will not support a man who denies justice to the victims who in this case are children and mocks the question,"" she wrote.

Trump's base accused Democrats of suppressing Epstein evidence, but now face the realisation Trump may be doing the same.

Adding to the MAGA demand is Elon Musk, the Trump ally-turned-foe.

The tech billionaire Elon Musk has taken aim at Trump over the case of Epstein, saying his new America Party will focus on releasing files from the case.

""How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won't release the Epstein files?"" Musk wrote on X, his social media platform.

When a user asked if exposing the files would rank high on priorities for the America Party, Musk affirmed by posting a ""100"" emoji.

Relations between Trump and Musk have soured, marked by public disputes after Musk criticised Trump's economic policies.

Musk suggested launching a new political party last month. He queried his X followers about creating one that ""represents the 80% in the middle"".

He later backed a supporter's suggestion to name the new party the America Party, similar to the America PAC (Political Action Committee) he launched last year, which spent $239 million supporting Trump and other Republicans in the 2024 elections.

Epstein working on behalf of Israel?

Tucker Carlson, a conservative political commentator who recently parted ways with Trump, is also among the leading critics of the handling of the Epstein files by the Trump administration.

Speaking last week at the 'Turning Point USA' summit in Florida, Carlson alleged that Epstein, who was accused of running a blackmail ring, was working on behalf of Israeli intelligence services.

""The real question is, why was he doing this, on whose behalf, and where did the money come from?"" Carlson said.

""I think the real answer is Jeffrey Epstein was working on behalf of intel services, probably not American. And we have every right to ask, on whose behalf was he working?

""Now, no one’s allowed to say that the foreign government is Israel because we have been somehow cowed into thinking that’s naughty. There is nothing wrong with saying that. There is nothing hateful about saying that,"" Carlson said.

""There’s nothing anti-Semitic about saying that. There’s nothing even anti-Israel about saying that,"" he added.

Carlson alluded to Ehud Barak's ties to Epstein. The former Israeli prime minister had reportedly met Epstein approximately 30 times between 2013 and 2017."

""It's a full complement with the batteries,"" Trump said on Monday when asked whether he would send Patriot missiles specifically, during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

""We're going to have some come very soon, within days... a couple of the countries that have Patriots are going to swap over and will replace the Patriots with the ones they have.""

""It will mean that Ukraine gets its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defence, but also missiles, ammunition,"" NATO chief Rutt told reporters.

The decision marks one of the most assertive steps of Trump administration against Russia.

The shift in tone comes just days after the Pentagon temporarily halted some shipments to Ukraine, citing concerns over shrinking US stockpiles.

But with Trump greenlighting a fresh tranche of weapons — including Patriot missile systems — reports say deliveries could resume within days.

On Monday, Trump also warned Russia that he will impose ""very severe"" tariffs against Moscow's remaining trade partners if it doesn't resolve its war in Ukraine within 50 days.

""We're going to be doing secondary tariffs. If we don't have a deal in 50 days, it's very simple. And they'll be at 100 percent, and that's the way it is,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.

The president suggested such levies could feature 100 percent tariffs.

It wasn't immediately clear what products could be targeted.

The plan is ""likely to include long-range missiles that could reach targets deep inside Russian territory, including Moscow,"" two sources told Axios news website.

It comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin refused to halt military offensive in Ukraine despite being corralled into peace talks by Trump, drawing increasing scorn and anger from the US president.

Moscow has also unleashed record waves of drone and missile strikes over the past few weeks, with the number of Ukrainian civilians killed or wounded in June hitting a three-year high, according to UN figures.

Trump won the election with a promise that he would end wars, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.

The leader had vowed to withdraw American support from Kiev, but now the president is reportedly willing to share US weapons with European partners who will, in turn, hand them to Ukraine.

""By selling weapons to European nations, rather than transferring them to Ukraine itself, Trump hopes to insulate himself from political criticism that he is reversing a campaign pledge to reduce the US role in the years-long war,"" CNN reported, citing an official.

'Better late than never'

In Kiev, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday hailed a ""productive meeting"" with Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg.

""We discussed the path to peace and what we can practically do together to bring it closer,"" Zelensky wrote on social media after the meeting.

""This includes strengthening Ukraine's air defense, joint production, and procurement of defence weapons in collaboration with Europe,"" he added.

Zelenskyy also said he was ""grateful to President Trump for the important signals of support and the positive decisions for both our countries,"" in an apparent reference to the pledge of new Patriots.

Asked what Europe expects from Trump's announcement later on Monday, a German government source told the AFP news agency: ""In concrete terms I think it means that from the US side, there will be approvals for the delivery of certain weapons.""

""There is an expectation from the American side that there will be considerable financial contributions to this end from the European side,"" the source added.

One Ukrainian soldier deployed in the war-scarred east of the country, who identified himself by his call sign Grizzly, welcomed Trump's promise of fresh air defence systems.

""Better late than never,"" he told AFP.

Meanwhile, Russian forces said on Monday they had captured new territory in eastern Ukraine with the seizure of two villages, one in the Donetsk region and another in the Zaporizhzhia region.

7/15/2016 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/397c957ee3ec,"The night Türkiye stood: Turkish women who defied coup with blood and resolveWhen women and children resisted a violent coup attempt in 2016 – the courage, resolve and sacrifice of unarmed civilians became central to Türkiye’s collective memory.","Nine years ago, on the night of 15 July 2016, Türkiye faced what would become one of the bloodiest and, yet, most resilient episodes in its modern history.

A faction of the military, affiliated with the Fetullah Terrorist Organisation (FETO), attempted to seize power by force. The putschist soldiers targeted key government institutions by air and ground, and attacked unarmed civilians who found themselves staring down tanks and automatic rifles.

Many civilians flooded the streets after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on the nation to resist. Speaking live en route from Marmaris to Istanbul Airport, he urged citizens to stand against the coup alongside him.

Leaked orders circulated among the instigators were stark that a coup commander instructed them to shoot without mercy: “There is a resisting crowd, directly shoot at them, there is no forgiveness to any of them. None.”

The woman who told a soldier, “I birthed you my son,” was not simply trying to reason with him; but evoking the shared code of maternal sacrifice and military service. His reply: “God will forgive us, don’t you worry.”

Met with determined civilian and police resistance, the coup failed. But not before 253 people were killed, among them eleven women, children, police officers, and hundreds more injured.

On the Bosphorus Bridge, now renamed the July 15 Martyrs’ Bridge, two women, Ayse Aykac (44) and Sevgi Yesilyurt (51), were killed.

Aykac, a mother of four, left home after hearing President Erdogan’s televised address. So did Yesilyurt, a mother of two. Both were gunned down by putschist soldiers on the bridge.

The youngest among the female martyrs were 23-year-old police officers Kubra Doganay and Cennet Yigit, classmates and colleagues, also killed in the line of resistance.

TRT World spoke to some of the women who survived that night, and the loved ones of the martyred women, who, too, embody the spirit of resistance.

‘If we stay, the homeland is ours’

The most persistent image of resistance from that night may be that of Adviyye Gul Ismailoglu from Fatih, Istanbul. She was just 14 years of age at the time of the coup.

“We only had our flag in our hands and ‘soldiers to the quarters’ chants in our mouth,” she tells TRT World. “I thought they wouldn’t do anything wrong or shoot at the people standing before them.”

It is an image so out of sync with the violence that met her.

“There were about 150 citizens around, we saw traitors in uniform forming a barricade and not letting people go to the municipality side,” she says, adding, “they started to shoot at citizens directly to kill.”

The bullet that tore through her back, leaving a hole around fifteen centimetres, missed her spine but damaged her lungs. She spent a week in a coma.

She was not, however, unconscious at the time of injury.

“That night was a turning point for me as it is for Türkiye,” she says. She ended her account with a quote from Yavuz Sultan Selim Han: “If we die, paradise is ours; if we stay, the homeland is ours.”

‘I lost my pillar of support, but not my country’

Others, like Turkmen Tekin, a 46-year-old mother of three, had responded instinctively to the events of the night. “The country is being lost, we have to act now,” she had told her husband.

Leaving her three children in bed, she had performed ablution (a ritual washing before prayer) and handed the house key to her sister-in-law, asking her to care for the kids. Her youngest child was just 11.

“My wife was so excited she didn’t even put on her shoes. She did not pause to dress properly,” Tekin’s widower Ramazan, tells TRT World.

They made for the local police station in Esenler, an Istanbul district on the European side, then rerouted toward Ataturk Airport after hearing the president’s location, hoping to join him there.

“We took to the streets for our homeland, for our flag, for the call to prayer. I’ve never felt regret or thought, “Why did we go out?” Because without a state, there is no homeland, no flag,” he adds.

Somewhere along the way, as tanks rolled forward, they were overtaken.

“We were walking, and people were shouting ‘a tank is coming’ one after another, or at least it seemed that way. In the buzz of that crowd, you couldn’t hear anything in that noise.”

When they realised the tank was driving towards them, Ramazan Tekin told his wife to move aside. “The traitors were driving that tank over us,” he tells TRT World.

“When I looked at my wife, I saw her on the ground.” She had been struck fatally on the skull. His eyes were moist as he recounted holding her in his arms, adding that he called out to her, but she couldn’t speak.

They rushed her to the hospital, but doctors could only confirm her death. He held her as she died, later telling reporters: “When I looked at her, she had the same smile, same white skin as she had on our wedding day.”

Turkmen Tekin, he adds, had always longed for martyrdom. “She would always say, ‘If only I were a soldier or served the state so I could become a martyr.’ God granted her the martyrdom she always wished for.”

He finds quiet strength in his wife’s sacrifice for her country, whose love unites them both.

“I lost my wife. I lost my pillar and support. But I didn’t lose my country.”

‘May the homeland live on’

There is heroism, moral courage and something almost operatic in these stories, the mother who leaves her children sleeping, the teenage girl standing defiantly in front of armed men, the husband carrying his wife’s bloodied body through a crowd.

These moments, and the stories that preserve them, is a retelling of the night the republic was almost lost, and preserved. The cost of forgetting would be even greater than the cost of resistance.

The events of that night are now stitched into the country’s national memory, institutionalised by a state holiday, and immortalised by narratives of martyrdom.

The killing of 253 people, some as young as 15, are memorialised. 15 July is marked by commemorative events, and interviews with survivors and bereaved families.

“Vatan sagolsun,” as one of the interviewees tells TRT World.

“May the homeland live on.”"

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa met with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan in Brussels to discuss regional developments and deepen EU-Armenia relations.

Von der Leyen welcomed Armenia’s draft peace treaty with Azerbaijan, calling it “a seismic moment” in the region’s history. “It brings decades of hostility to a close. I hope the treaty can be signed as soon as possible,” she said.

Pashinyan reiterated Yerevan’s commitment to democratic reforms and closer integration with the EU.

""We are working to have a deeper and broader partnership with Armenia, and we want to develop our relationship,"" Costa added.

In a joint statement, the EU leaders affirmed support for Armenia’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and democratic trajectory.

They welcomed recent progress on visa liberalisation and highlighted Armenia’s newly adopted legislation initiating the country’s European integration process.

The leaders voiced support for integrating Armenia into regional infrastructure and economic initiatives, particularly those linked to the Black Sea.

Brussels reiterated its commitment to Armenia’s long-term development through stepped-up financial and technical aid.

Under the Global Gateway strategy, EU investments in Armenia are expected to reach $2.9 billion.

The $317 million Resilience and Growth Plan, announced in April, also raises EU funding by 50 percent to back reforms and investments in key sectors.

Regional connectivity was another key topic, with the EU reaffirming support for Armenia’s Crossroads of Peace initiative – a proposed infrastructure network aimed at opening regional trade routes, including with Türkiye and Azerbaijan.

Security cooperation also featured prominently, including the launch of new EU-Armenia Security and Defense consultations, signalling Brussels’ growing role in the South Caucasus as traditional Russian influence wanes.

The EU leaders said the meeting marked “an important step” in advancing relations and looked ahead to more progress at the upcoming EU-Armenia Partnership Council this autumn.

Pashinyan’s visit follows a recent trip by EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas to Yerevan, where both sides reiterated their push for stronger cooperation and lasting regional peace."

""Defence, strengthening security, weapons, sanctions, protecting our people, strengthening cooperation between Ukraine and the United States — there are many topics to discuss,"" Andriy Yermak wrote on the Telegram messaging app on Monday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his evening address on Sunday that he had instructed military commanders to present Kellogg with information on Russia's capabilities and Ukraine's prospects.

Kellogg will also meet the heads of the Security Service of Ukraine and intelligence services, he added.

""Negotiations on further support will take place during the week,"" Zelenskyy said, adding that he wanted the United States to understand fully what could be done to ""compel Russia to (make) peace"".

Cambodia's parliament in 2006 approved a law that would require all Cambodians aged 18 to 30 to serve in the military for 18 months, although it has never been enforced.

Relations with neighbouring Thailand have been tense since May, when a long-standing territorial dispute flared into cross-border clashes, killing one Cambodian soldier.

""This episode of confrontation is a lesson for us and is an opportunity for us to review, assess and set our targets to reform our military,"" Hun Manet said.

""From 2026, the military conscription law will be implemented,"" he said in a ceremony at the Royal Gendarmerie Training Centre in central Kampong Chhnang province.

Hun Manet said the service period would be extended from the 18 months outlined in the legislation passed two decades ago to 24 months pledged to ""look at increasing"" Cambodia's defence budget.

""Our national defence, the building of our military, is not to invade anybody's territory but it is to protect our territory,"" he added.

The Cambodian soldier was killed by Thai troops in a firefight in a disputed area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of both countries and Laos meet.

The incident soured relations between Phnom Penh and Bangkok, causing the closure of border crossings as Cambodia banned fuel and gas imports from Thailand.

It also caused a domestic political crisis in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has been suspended from office pending an ethics probe over her conduct during the row.

A diplomatic call between Paeotongtarn and Hun Manet's father, former leader Hun Sen, was leaked from the Cambodian side, sparking a judicial investigation.

Neighbouring Thailand already has military conscription for young and able-bodied men, who enter a lottery to determine whether they have to serve."

About the “Terror-Free Türkiye” process, the president said: “We see that our messages, which reassure our friends and brothers while instilling fear in our adversaries and rivals, are reaching their target.""

He said that Ankara is closely monitoring the PKK terror group’s disarmament process on the ground through the mechanism established by the National Intelligence Organisation and the Turkish Armed Forces.

""We are aware of whom and which power centers we are fighting against. Our counterparts are not the puppets themselves, but the puppeteers who operate them,"" Erdogan said.

“We are on the verge of completely freeing our nation from the shackles of terrorism that imposed upon it 47 years ago,” Erdogan said, adding: “We have already begun to see concrete signs of this.”

He expressed hope that all political parties with parliamentary groups will support with goodwill the steps to be taken at the Turkish parliament, emphasizing that no one has the right to derail, undermine, or sabotage this process, especially not to pursue petty political gains on such a critical issue.

In life and politics, almost everything can be compensated for, but there is no making up for obstructing a matter this vital, one that affects the unity, solidarity, social peace, and stability of our 86 million citizens, he said.

“Whatever we do, we do it with the sensitivities of all members of our nation in mind, especially the relatives of our martyrs and our veterans, as well as considering the future interests of our country, Erdogan said.

The Turkish president underlined that it should not be forgotten that this new era, whose parameters are being shaped, places significant responsibilities not only on the Justice and Development (AK) Party, Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), Democracy and Peoples' Equality and Democracy (DEM) Party, but on the entire political establishment and all political actors."

On Sunday, heavy police and paramilitary deployments were reported across the city in the early hours, with entry points to Khawaja Bazar, home to the graves of the 22 Kashmiris killed during the uprising, barred to all but official and security vehicles, according to local media.

Prominent Kashmiri figures, including Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, said they were placed under house arrest.

""Homes have been locked from the outside, police & central forces deployed as jailers, and major bridges in Srinagar blocked,"" Abdullah posted on X.

""All to stop people from visiting a historically important graveyard. I will never understand what the Law & Order government is so afraid of.""

Crackdown and assault on democratic rights

The crackdown comes amid rising criticism of the region’s political climate following the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status by New Delhi in 2019.

Until 2020, July 13 had been observed as a public holiday known as Kashmir Martyrs’ Day, commemorating the 1931 killings of 22 protestors under the rule of the Dogra Maharaja, then aligned with British colonial rule.

This year, the National Conference party said it formally requested permission to visit the gravesite but was denied by the district administration.

Srinagar Police posted a public advisory on X confirming that all such requests had been rejected, warning that “any violation… shall invite strict legal action.”

“This is not just a date—it’s a reminder of sacrifice, dignity, and the fight for justice,” said National Conference spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq.

The MoU was signed by Azerbaijan’s Economy Minister and SOCAR’s Supervisory Board Chairman Mikayil Jabbarov, and Syrian Energy Minister Mohammed al-Bashir.

“Today, I accompanied (Syrian) President Ahmad al Sharaa in an official visit to Azerbaijan where we discussed ways to enhance cooperation in the field of natural gas to secure the future of energy in Syria,” Bashir said in a statement on X.

“An agreement was signed with SOCAR regarding the supply of natural gas to Syria, a step towards energy independence and building strategic partnerships that serve the nation and its citizens,” he added.

Earlier this month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan quoted his Azerbaijani counterpart, Ilham Aliyev, as saying that Azerbaijan is “ready to provide all kinds of support on natural gas to Syria.”

Sharaa arrived in Azerbaijan early Saturday for his first official visit to the country since taking office earlier this year.

A statement by the Azerbaijani presidency said that Aliyev and Sharaa held talks attended by ministers and other officials from both sides.

“Due to the unfriendly policies of the previous Syrian government toward Azerbaijan, bilateral relations had experienced a period of stagnation,” Aliyev said.

He, however, emphasized that the establishment of a new government in Syria “has opened significant prospects for the advancement of ties.”

The Syrian president, for his part, thanked his Azerbaijani counterpart for his support to Syria.

He said that the ousted regime “had damaged relations with many countries, including Azerbaijan.”

He affirmed Syria’s interest in cooperating with Azerbaijan in political, economic, trade, cultural, humanitarian, and other areas.

Discussions between the two leaders also covered cooperation in humanitarian, educational, and cultural fields, including the provision of scholarships for Syrian students in Azerbaijan and the restoration of cultural monuments, according to the statement.

First official visit to Azerbaijan

Syrian President Ahmed al Sharaa arrived in Azerbaijan on Saturday for his first official visit to the country since taking office earlier this year, according to Syria’s official news agency SANA and Azerbaijan’s state-run AZERTAC.

While neither agency disclosed the duration or full agenda of the visit, it marks another stop in al Sharaa’s diplomatic tour that began following his appointment on Jan. 29.

Since assuming office, he has visited Türkiye, France, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait.

A transitional administration led by al Sharaa was formed in Syria in January following the fall of the regime of Bashar al Assad.

Assad, who ruled Syria for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia in December, ending the Baath Party’s decades-long grip on power that began in 1963."

The news comes four months after Bangladesh’s Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed formal charges against Wazed, accusing her of fraud, forgery, and abuse of power.

Wazed, who assumed the WHO position in January 2024, had faced strong opposition from student-led movements following her mother’s removal from power in a mass uprising last August.

In an internal email, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus informed staff that Wazed would be stepping aside.

Assistant Director-General Dr Catharina Boehme will serve as Officer-in-Charge during her absence, the report said.

In a statement posted on Facebook, a spokesperson for Bangladesh’s transitional government leader, Muhammad Yunus, welcomed the WHO's decision.

“This is an important first step toward accountability,” the post read.

“But a lasting solution requires Wazed’s permanent removal, the revocation of her privileges, and a firm commitment to restoring integrity to this critical UN role.”

The ACC alleges that Wazed misrepresented her academic qualifications during her campaign for the regional directorship, including falsely claiming an honorary role at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University in Dhaka.

The university has publicly disputed her claim.

Saima Wazed also faces accusations of leveraging her official position to funnel approximately $2.8 million from various banks to the Shuchona Foundation, an organisation she formerly led.

Arrest warrants for corruption cases

According to officials, Wazed has not returned to her office in Bangladesh in recent months and is believed to be avoiding authorities as arrest warrants have been issued for her, her mother, and other members of her family in connection with multiple corruption cases.

The World Health Organization’s South-East Asia Regional Office (SEARO) includes 11 member states and plays a pivotal role in public health strategy and implementation across the region.

Correction: An earlier version of this article had wrongly stated that WHO had accused Wazed of corruption. The corruption investigation is instead being carried out by Bangladesh’s interim government."

His family said settlers prevented ambulances from reaching him for hours.

By the time he arrived at a hospital, he had died from his injuries.

He was reportedly shot and left bleeding at the scene, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.

The Israeli military said it was investigating the incident, which took place during what it described as a ""violent confrontation"" involving arson, property damage, and physical clashes.

No arrests have been announced.

The US State Department confirmed it was aware of reports of a US citizen killed in the occupied West Bank, saying: ""We have no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens overseas,"" but declined further comment out of respect for the family’s privacy, according to Zeteo.

Musallet, born in Florida and raised in Port Charlotte, had been visiting Palestine since June.

Alikhbaria Syria reported that ""Israeli occupation forces deliberately ignited fires in tens of dunams of land"" near the separation fence west of Al Rafid, a town in southwestern Syria.

One dunam equals 1,000 square metres.

The channel said that UN personnel were attempting to extinguish the blaze using basic tools but were struggling to contain it.

No additional information was provided.

Earlier on Friday, Muhammad al Saeed, Deputy Governor of Quneitra, told Anadolu Agency that Israel had built more than eight military bases in the northern part of the governorate — including in the Yarmuk Basin — following the fall of Bashar al Assad in December 2024.

He said the bases were constructed within the buffer zone established by the 1974 Disengagement Agreement, calling it a ""clear violation"" of the accord.

Al Saeed added that Israeli activity had blocked access to around 6,000 hectares (14,800 acres) of farmland and pastures, cutting off income sources for families dependent on livestock.

Israel seized most of the Golan Heights during the 1967 Middle East War and later annexed the territory — a move not recognised internationally.

Since Assad’s departure to Russia and the formation of a transitional administration under President Ahmad al Sharaa in January, Israel has increased its aggression in Syria.

Protesters engaged in a tense standoff on Friday with authorities at one of the farms during the operation.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement that authorities executed criminal search warrants in Carpinteria and Camarillo, California, on Thursday.

They arrested immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally and there were also at least 10 immigrant children on site, the statement said.

Four US citizens were arrested for ""assaulting or resisting officers,"" the department said.

Authorities were offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of one person suspected of firing a gun at federal agents. At least one worker was hospitalised with grave injuries.

During the raid, crowds of people gathered outside Glass House Farms at the Camarillo location to demand information about their relatives and protest immigration enforcement.

A chaotic scene emerged outside the farm that grows tomatoes, cucumbers and cannabis as authorities clad in helmets and uniforms faced off with the demonstrators. Acrid green and white billowing smoke then forced community members to retreat.

ICE raids on farms

On Friday, about two dozen people waited outside the Camarillo farm to collect the cars of their loved ones and speak to managers about what happened.

Relatives of Jaime Alanis, who worked picking tomatoes for 10 years, said he called his wife in Mexico during the raid to tell her immigration agents had arrived and that he was hiding with others inside the farm.

""The next thing we heard was that he was in the hospital,"" Juan Duran, Alanis’ brother-in-law, said in Spanish, his voice breaking.

It was not immediately clear how Alanis was injured. A doctor told the family that others who brought Alanis to the hospital said he had fallen from the roof of a building.

Alanis had a broken neck, fractured skull and a rupture in an artery that pumps blood to the brain, said his niece Yesenia, who didn’t want to share her last name for fear of reprisal.

Maria Servin, 68, said her son Rafael Ortiz has worked at the farm for 18 years and was helping build a greenhouse when federal immigrations agents arrived on Thursday.

Servin said she spoke to her son, who is undocumented, after hearing of the raid and offered to pick him up. ""He said not to come because they were surrounded and there was even a helicopter. That was the last time I spoke to him,"" Servin, who is a naturalised US citizen, said in Spanish.

She said she went to the farm anyway on Thursday, but agents were shooting tear gas and rubber bullets, and she decided it wasn't safe to stay.

On Friday, she returned with her daughter and was told her son had been arrested. The family still doesn’t know where he is being held or how to contact him. ""I regret 1,000 times that I didn't help him get his documents,"" Servin said.

Here's what's at stakeSimmering feud between US President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell enters a perilous phase, with Fed independence, financial credibility, and a $2.5B renovation caught in crossfire.","Washington, DC — The war between US President Donald Trump and Jerome Powell has gone from simmering to full boil.

Once a slow burn of offhanded digs, Trump's campaign against the Federal Reserve Chair he appointed has erupted into a coordinated, multi-agency offensive. Now, with $2.5 billion in Fed headquarters renovations under the microscope and allies in federal commissions circling, the question that once seemed academic now is swirling in Washington: Can Trump actually fire Powell?

Legally, the short answer remains no. But politically, the pressure has never been hotter.

Trump's dislike for Powell is no secret.

In meetings, in posts, even in handwritten letters, the president has railed against the Fed boss, calling him ""Too Late"" for not acting swiftly enough during the 2022 inflation crisis and, more recently, for refusing to cut interest rates despite Trump's urgings.

""Lower the rate — by a lot!"" Trump scrawled in a note to Powell last month, underscoring his desire to juice the economy ahead of a tough election year.

Powell has kept his responses stoic, almost monk-like. At press conferences and testimony alike, he has insisted the Fed's decisions are rooted in data, not politics. When pressed about Trump's pressure, Powell has said little, if anything, a silence that has only fuelled the president's fury.

Renovation becomes a flashpoint

This week, that fury turned surgical.

Russell Vought, Trump's Office of Management and Budget director, accused Powell of lying to Congress about the ballooning cost of the Fed's headquarters overhaul.

In a public letter, Vought claimed Powell violated oversight laws and ploughed ahead with ""an ostentatious"" renovation in the heart of the US capital.

""The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,"" Vought wrote, adding that Powell’s stewardship ""does not comply with federal regulations.""

The project's cost, originally estimated at $1.9 billion, has grown to $2.5 billion — a jump the Fed attributes to material inflation, labour shortages, and leasing extensions. In June, Powell told Congress there were no extravagant perks in the renovation: ""no VIP dining room, no new marble... just old elevators that have been there.""

Trump officials aren't buying it.

In a move that went largely unnoticed at first, the president replaced three members of the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees federal renovations, with White House loyalists, including Deputy Chief of Staff James Blair. After their first commission meeting, Blair said Powell may have misled Congress and called for site visits and full plan disclosures.

""The project is either out of alignment with the plans... or Chair Powell was dishonest with the Senate Banking Committee,"" Blair said.

Legal Roadblocks and work arounds

Trump is pushing the Fed to slash interest rates, betting that cheaper borrowing will ignite a surge in spending and investment, sparking economic growth.

Powell is resisting lowering interest rates due to concerns that Trump's tariff policies could increase inflation, requiring more data before acting.

This has infuriated Trump, especially since he cannot directly fire Powell. A recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential power reinforced the notion that while executive officials serve at the president’s pleasure, the Fed is different — a ""quasi-private"" entity intentionally insulated from short-term political interference.

""The law’s clear,"" analysts say. ""The Fed's independence is baked into its structure.""

Still, Trump allies appear to be pursuing an alternate path: lay the groundwork for firing Powell ""for cause,"" or wear him down until he resigns.

That's what some read in Vought's accusations and Blair's investigation: not just criticism, but a case for misconduct.

President Trump has sharply criticised Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for refusing to cut interest rates.

Peter Navarro, the president's longtime economic adviser, has labelled Powell ""one of the worst Fed chairs in history."" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said flatly: ""He's got to change, and he's got to go.""

And while Powell's term doesn’t expire until May 2026, Trump has hinted he may name a successor soon, a move that some worry could create a ""shadow chair"" dynamic that undercuts Powell’s authority before he even steps down.Bill Pulte, director of the US Federal Housing Finance Agency, says he's encouraged by reports that Powell may be considering stepping down.Markets watching closely

The White House insists there's no formal effort to remove Powell. A senior official told CNN that Trump is not plotting an ouster.

Regardless of intent, financial markets are on edge. Any serious attempt to fire the Fed Chair could send Wall Street into a tailspin, analysts warn, especially if it signals that the central bank has lost its political independence.

""If markets lose faith in the Fed, rates don't go lower,"" one analyst said. ""They go higher.""

Even former Fed officials have sounded alarms.

""The anticipated market effect is a disincentive to try to remove the chair,"" said ex-Governor Daniel Tarullo. The chaos would arrive well before any court ruled on the legality of such a move.

That may explain the administration's more subtle strategy: dial up the noise, tighten the legal screws, and let the pressure do the rest.

Trump’s shortlist to replace Powell is already in motion. Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and vocal critic of current policy, has emerged as a top contender.

So has Kevin Hassett, Trump’s former economic adviser, who once helped dissuade the president from firing Powell, but now appears more open to change.

The message is clear: Even if Powell can't be fired, he can be sidelined by the White House.At its core, this isn't just a feud between two powerful men. It's a fight over the soul of the Fed.

Trump wants rates lower. Powell wants inflation down. Somewhere in between lies a volatile economy, a nervous market, and the world’s financial anchor walking the tightrope between data and doubt."

The layoffs that started on Friday will cover 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service officers based in the United States, according to an internal State Department notice sent to the workforce and seen by Reuters news agency.

""The Department is streamlining domestic operations to focus on diplomatic priorities,"" the notice said.

""Headcount reductions have been carefully tailored to affect non-core functions, duplicative or redundant offices, and offices where considerable efficiencies may be found,"" it added.

The move is the first step of a restructuring that Trump has sought to ensure US foreign policy is aligned with his ""America First"" agenda.

'An act of vandalism'

Former diplomats and critics say the firing of foreign service officers risks America's ability to counter the growing assertiveness from adversaries such as China and Russia.

""As the US retreats, our adversaries — like the People’s Republic of China — are expanding their diplomatic reach, making Americans less safe and less prosperous. If this administration is serious about putting 'America first,' it must invest in our diplomatic corps and national security experts — not erode the institutions that protect our interests, promote US values and keep Americans abroad safe,"" a statement by ranking Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee warned.

""This is bad management of an important resource: American diplomats,"" said a statement from The American Academy of Diplomacy, which represents former ambassadors.

""At a time when the United States faces unprecedented challenges from strategic competitors and adversaries, ongoing conflicts in Central Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, and emerging security threats, the decision to gut the Department of State’s institutional knowledge and operational capacity is an act of vandalism.""

Trump in February ordered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to revamp the foreign service to ensure that the Republican president's foreign policy is ""faithfully"" implemented.

He has also repeatedly pledged to ""clean out the deep state"" by firing bureaucrats that he deems disloyal.

The shake-up is part of an unprecedented push by Trump to shrink the federal bureaucracy and cut what he says is wasteful spending of taxpayer money.

The reorganisation had been expected to be largely concluded by July 1 but did not proceed as planned amid ongoing litigation, as the State Department waited for the US Supreme Court to weigh in on the Trump administration's bid to halt a judicial order blocking mass job cuts.

On Tuesday, the Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to pursue the job cuts and the sweeping downsising of numerous agencies, a decision that could lead to tens of thousands of layoffs while dramatically reshaping the federal bureaucracy.

Trump reshaping American diplomacy

""The Supreme Court's recent near-unanimous decision allows the reorganisation to commence and will ensure that the department moves at the speed of relevancy and restores the department to its roots of results-driven democracy,"" State Department Spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told media on Thursday.

""The plan, which has been approved by the Secretary and developed with extensive feedback from Congress and the workforce itself, is moving into implementation.""

Foreign service officers affected will be placed immediately on administrative leave for 120 days, after which they will formally lose their jobs, according to an internal notice obtained by The Associated Press.

For most affected civil servants, the separation period is 60 days, it said.

The Trump administration has pushed to reshape American diplomacy and worked aggressively to shrink the size of the federal government, including mass dismissals as part of moves to dismantle whole departments like the US Agency for International Development and the Education Department.

USAID, the six-decade-old foreign assistance agency, was absorbed into the State Department last week after the administration dramatically slashed foreign aid funding."

Aoun's statement on Friday is the first official reaction to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar's statement last week in which he expressed his country's interest in normalising ties with Lebanon and Syria.

Aoun ""distinguished between peace and normalisation"", according to a statement shared by the presidency.

""Peace is the lack of a state of war, and this is what matters to us in Lebanon at the moment. As for the issue of normalisation, it is not currently part of Lebanese foreign policy,"" the president said in front of a delegation from an Arab think tank.

Lebanon and Syria have technically been in a state of war with Israel since 1948, with Damascus saying that talks of normalisation were ""premature"".

The president called on Israel to withdraw from the five points near the border it still occupies. Israel was required to fully withdraw from southern Lebanon under a November ceasefire seeking to end its war with Hezbollah.

Aoun said that Israeli troops in Lebanon ""obstruct the complete deployment of the army up to the internationally recognised borders"".

According to the ceasefire agreement, Hezbollah must pull its fighters north of the Litani River, around 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the border with Israel, leaving the Lebanese army and UN peacekeepers as the only armed parties in the area.

The United States has been calling on Lebanon to fully disarm Hezbollah, and Lebanese authorities sent their response to Washington's demand this week.

The response was not made public, but Aoun stated that Beirut was determined to ""hold the monopoly over weapons in the country"".

The implementation of this move ""will take into account the interest of the state and its security stability to preserve civil peace on one hand, and national unity on the other"", hinting that Hezbollah's disarmament will not be done through force.

Hezbollah, a powerful political force in Lebanon, is the only non-state actor to have officially retained its weaponry after the end of Lebanon's 15-year civil war in 1990, as parts of southern Lebanon were still under Israeli occupation at the time.

The Lebanese group was heavily weakened following its year-long hostilities with Israel, which escalated into a two-month war in September."

They stressed the “safe, secure, and dignified” repatriation of the Rohingya, who are mostly Muslims and have fled Myanmar due to oppression and genocide, particularly since 2017, with over a million of them now living in neighbouring Bangladesh.

The reiteration of support came after foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) met this week in Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur.

“We reaffirmed ASEAN’s continued support for Myanmar’s efforts to bring peace, stability, and the rule of law, promote harmony and reconciliation among the various communities, as well as ensure sustainable and equitable development in Rakhine State,” the top diplomats said in a joint statement.

Without directly identifying the displaced people as Rohingya, the bloc’s top diplomats also welcomed “continued engagement and cooperation” between Myanmar and Bangladesh, including bilateral repatriation initiatives for the verified displaced persons from Rakhine state.

“We looked forward to ASEAN’s continued facilitation of the repatriation process,” the joint statement said.

On internal conflicts in Myanmar, the bloc reaffirmed “continued support” to the nation’s “efforts to bring peace, stability, and the rule of law, promote harmony and reconciliation among the various communities, as well as ensure sustainable and equitable development in Rakhine State.”

The United Nations refugee agency on Friday said essential services for the Rohingya refugee population in Bangladesh are at risk of collapsing unless more money is found.""There is a huge gap in terms of what we need and what resources are available. These funding gaps will affect the daily living of Rohingya refugees as they depend on humanitarian support daily for food, health and education,"" UNHCHR spokesperson Babar Baloch told reporters in Geneva.

Myanmar, ruled by a military junta since February 2021, is currently facing a case over the genocide of Rohingya at the International Court of Justice.

Following the military coup, ASEAN decided to disinvite Myanmar from its annual meetings.

The junta has, however, said it will hold elections in the Buddhist-majority nation towards the end of this year or early this year."

Often called “Bosnia’s Yunus Emre,” Dzemaludin Latic speaks to TRT World about his days with Alija Izetbegovic, memory and resistance.","On the anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, remembrance returns not only through names etched in stone but through voices that tremble with grief.

This year, the identities of seven more victims were confirmed, thirty years after their lives were taken. For many others, the remains are still unnamed, their stories still suspended in silence.

Each year, the Srebrenica Inferno oratorio is performed to honour the thousands of innocent lives lost and the survivors who still carry the weight of memory.

First staged in 2003 at the opening of the Srebrenica Potocari Memorial Centre, the oratorio blends poetry and music into a haunting act of testimony.

Written by 68-year-old Bosnian poet, academic Dzemaludin Latic and brought to life through the music of Delo Jusic, the piece is performed by the Srebrenica Children’s Choir, where sorrowful voices pierce the silence of history.

This composition was born of memory. Latic, now 68, lived through the war, shared a prison cell with Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia’s first president, and bore witness to the systematic destruction of his people.

Latic’s anthem, Ja Sin Sam Tvoj (“I Am Your Son”), was unanimously declared the “anthem of the Bosnian people” at the First Bosnian Congress in 1993.

‘To bear witness to history’

“On the night of July 10, as Srebrenica’s fall began, Alija summoned me to the Presidency building,” Latic tells TRT World.

In July 1995, as Serbian forces closed in on the UN-declared “safe zone” of Srebrenica, President Izetbegovic summoned Latic to the Presidency building.

“To this day, I still don’t know why he called me that night, perhaps so I could bear witness to history. He was pacing alone in a room, visibly anxious. I’m not even sure he noticed when I entered.”

The building’s communication system was broadcasting live reports from a journalist named Nino, reporting from within Srebrenica.

“I can still hear his voice: ‘The Chetniks are advancing… people are retreating…’”

Then, just before dawn, Nino made his final call. “He said: ‘This may be my last report.”

“It was a terrifying moment. To this day, I don’t know how Alija endured that night.”

Latic describes this moment as one when the world failed to prevent a genocide.

“It is clear. They were killing us simply because we are Muslims.”

Between 11 and 22 July 1995, under General Ratko Mladic, the Army of the Republika Srpska murdered more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys. The massacre unfolded in full view of Dutch UN peacekeepers stationed in the demilitarised town.

“They didn’t kill over 8,000 of our people because they were cowards,” Latic says. “They killed us because we were Muslims.”

“French General Philippe Morillon promised that heavy weapons would be taken from the forces of Republika Srpska, but that promise was never kept. Srebrenica was destroyed because it stood in the way of a unified Republika Srpska and the vision of Greater Serbia.”

Only after the enclave’s destruction did Serbian leaders begin to engage in peace negotiations, culminating in the Dayton Agreement.

“They did the same thing during World War II,” Latic says.

“The Serbs first ‘cleansed’ the entire Podrinje region of Muslims, then made a pact with Tito and the Partisan movement, came to Jajce, and under Churchill’s patronage, established the federal Yugoslavia.”

Pen against the sword

Although Latic, as a member of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was awarded the two highest military honours for his contributions to the defence of the Bosnians and Muslims, he says his real struggle came because of the pen.

“The national weekly newspaper Ljiljan, which I edited, brought together the best journalists and was widely read in besieged Sarajevo, and abroad, even in Türkiye,” he recalls.

The paper combated propaganda from ethnic Serb and Croat forces aiming to discredit the Bosniak struggle for freedom, according to Latic.

“At the time, the aggressor forces had destroyed our radio and television transmitters and cut off our communication lines.”

What shaped Latic’s life most profoundly was his writing.

With the publication of his first book, he was recognised throughout Bosnia, and soon after, across Yugoslavia.

“In Belgrade, I was seen as a young Yugoslav poet. After receiving an award, Alija Izetbegovic expressed interest in meeting me. From that day until his passing, we remained close friends for 23 years.”

In August 1983, Latic, and a group of Muslim intellectuals, including Alija Izetbegovic, were sentenced in the “Sarajevo Process,”for alleged hostile activity, charges largely based on Izetbegovic’s 1970s Islamic Declaration in socialist Yugoslavia.

He was later released in 1986 following the intervention of the International PEN Club. He stayed back while his wife and children emigrated to Slovenia via many refugee camps. He continues to live as a poet and academic in Sarajevo.

Before I met the late Alija, says Latic, “I had already rejected membership in the Communist Party. I turned down an offer to become a teaching assistant at the Faculty of Philosophy, Department of Literature. I refused to serve a system that was hostile to Islam and Muslims. I never regretted that.”

“Not many people know this, but the aggressors attempted to assassinate Alija three times,” he says. “They tried to poison me in Foca, but Allah [God] saved me.”

“Everyone revered Alija. He was sensitive towards me. When I was transferred to Foca after becoming ill with tuberculosis, he carried that as a burden. I had been arrested because of my connection to him.”

He condemned the arrests and would say: ‘How pathetic are those who arrest poets!’

“Those of us in Zenica were fighting to stay alive,” he says. “Had an attack on Bosnia begun during those years, I am certain we would have been the first to be executed.”

Several of their comrades were killed. Irfan Ljubijankic, the foreign minister, and Prime Minister Hakija Turajlic were both assassinated.

Zenica Prison, he says, “was among the harshest. They didn’t want to kill us directly. But they made life so unbearable for us to die from illness or exhaustion.”

In the prison, Latic would read his poems aloud to Alija.

One Autumn Day, described the execution of 2,000 Muslims on the Drina Bridge during World War II.

“Our prison was right next to that bridge. Alija cried like a child when he heard it.”

From One Autumn Day:

One autumn day, as the poplars were shedding their leaves,

An old woman with a yemeni scarf stepped onto the bridge…

They were all bloodied, drowned by the Drina — the Drina that still trembles —

In the February of the 1940s — amid the screams of death!

Later, walking in the yard, Alija told him: “One day, when we are free, we will engrave your verses on the memorial stone for martyrs, Dzemal.”

“Those dreams,” Latic adds quietly, “never came true.”

“Alija is no longer with us. I walk the streets of Sarajevo like a stranger. I often smile as I pass places filled with memories, silently greeting them, and return home heavy-hearted, realising I no longer have anyone left to talk to.”

“Everything reminds him of those years. Our past lives within us. We cannot, and should not, detach from it.”

Today, he sees survival itself as a kind of divine plan.

“After the Dayton Agreement, the dismantling of all state symbols began: our flag, our national radio and television, and my small but significant poem.”

Because of this anthem, Muslim Bosniaks, Turks and others began to refer to Latic as the national poet.

“Extreme secularist circles ensured that the composition for the new Bosnian national anthem was written by Ranko Rihtman, a composer living in Tel Aviv,” he says.

When a competition was announced to find lyrics to accompany the composition, Latic submitted a new text at the last moment.

According to what he later learned from members of the selection committee; his lyrics had made it into the top five.

However, the committee decided not to continue working and dissolved as its term ended. Since then, no new committee has been established, nor has any new anthem text been officially adopted.

“I believe you can guess why,” he adds.

“Unfortunately, no one mentions it today, and it would not be appropriate for me to keep bringing it up,” Latic says.

And so, Bosnia has remained with a national anthem that has no lyrics.

‘Necip Fazil is my inspiration, my poetic love’

Still, the poet resonates in many hearts.

“When I came to Türkiye for the first time after the war, I was surprised to see how deeply the Turkish people admired me and referred to me as the national poet.”

He remembers a Friday in Adapazari where he travelled for a cultural event. After prayer, word spread that the Bosnian “national poet” was in town.

Shopkeepers gathered, offered tea. One man approached, phone in hand, playing Ben Senin Oglunum (“I Am Your Son”). “Every poet would dream of being welcomed like that.”

Latic received the inaugural Necip Fazil International Culture and Art Award in 2017.

“I am grateful for this award, especially because of the name it bears. Necip Fazil is my inspiration, my poetic love.”

He recalls arriving in Istanbul and being welcomed at the historic Sirkeci Station by Sezai Karakoc.

Later, he would meet Nuri Pakdil at the Istanbulensis Poetry Festival.

“Karakoc gifted me one of his books. I also have Cile by Necip Fazil. If God grants me life and health, I will learn Turkish, especially for its ‘Magnificent Seven’ and translate their poems. I’ve already translated Karakoc’s Mona Roza.”

This poetic exchange, he believes, is more than literary admiration. It is testament to a transnational brotherhood that endured genocide, exile, and silence.

Latic plans to publish a four-part novel in Turkish, telling the story of Bosnia’s tragedy and the “Young Muslims,” the anti-fascist, anti-communist movement led by Izetbegovic.

Often called the “Bosnian Yunus Emre,” Latic has written over 200 ilahis and kasides that resonate throughout the Balkans. Yet, humility defines his path.

“I made a promise to my nation: God willing, I will write 999 ilahis (Islamic spiritual hymns) and kasides (Ottoman-style odes for religious figures), but never a thousand. Writing more would feel like disrespect, as if I were trying to surpass my master, the eternal Yunus.”

For a man who once heard the final cries of Srebrenica, wrote elegies beside prison walls and dreamt of stone memorials, this moment of recognition in Türkiye is not merely a tribute.

It is a vindication: that words endure where borders fail."

Zelenskyy made the remarks following a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa on the sidelines of the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Rome.

“I thanked them for the new support package worth over €2 billion ($2.3 billion). The creation of the European Flagship Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine is also important. It will help attract more investment into Ukraine,” he said.

He added that Ukraine’s European integration remains a top priority and underlined that “a solution must be found to overcome Hungary’s veto.”

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has expressed strong opposition to Ukraine's potential accession to the EU, warning that integrating a country at war would pose a serious threat to the bloc's stability.

Zelenskyy also held separate bilateral meetings with the leaders of Germany, Finland, Poland and Bulgaria.

Following his talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for Berlin’s military support, especially in air defence systems.

“I informed Friedrich about the latest Russian attacks and spoke about our interceptor drones, which are already shooting down dozens of ‘Shaheds’ in a single attack,” he said on X.

He welcomed Germany’s readiness to help scale up drone production and emphasised its influential role in supporting Ukraine’s EU accession path.

“Germany is precisely the country that has the clout and authority to help unblock our path to the EU,” he said.

Zelenskyy also met with Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo and thanked him for Finland’s consistent support and the strong presence of Finnish companies at the recovery forum.

He stressed the urgency of boosting Ukraine’s drone production and joint ventures to counter Russian-Iranian drone attacks.

In his talks with Bulgarian Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov, Zelenskyy said they agreed to deepen cooperation in the energy sector, particularly on energy security.

He also thanked Bulgaria for supporting Ukraine’s EU path and participation in the “Coalition of the Willing.”

Zelenskyy additionally met with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and thanked him for Poland’s defence assistance, participation in the conference, and joining the European Flagship Fund.

He said Ukraine is interested in cooperating with Poland within the SAFE programme and joint weapons manufacturing efforts.

He also emphasised the importance of Poland as a “key logistical and transit hub for international assistance.”

Earlier in the day, Zelenskyy joined a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing, which included 32 representatives of states, governments and organisations.

For the first time, US officials such as General Keith Kellogg and Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal participated.

“It is important that the format of the Coalition of the Willing is working – working for long-term security and for protection against Russian strikes right now,” Zelenskyy said."

Since May, Palestinians say, GHF's distribution sites have become ""death traps"", resulting in killings of some 700 hungry Palestinians.","Washington DC — The United States has urged UN and global aid agencies to partner with the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) — the newly created American organisation backed by Israel to feed Gaza's starving and besieged Palestinian population — claiming the group has to date distributed millions of meals and prevented its alleged looting ""by Hamas.""

""There are now 69 million meals that have been distributed to date at four distribution centres, all while preventing Hamas looting, which is of course an incredible feat, that should be commended and supported,"" US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said on Thursday during a media briefing.

""We also call on other aid agencies and the UN to participate.""

Bruce hailed the system, saying it aligns with President Donald Trump's directives for innovative regional solutions.

""It has been implemented and it works, and of course it's part of the creative solutions that the president has asked for regarding that region,"" she added.

The more than two million residents of Gaza are facing dire humanitarian conditions as Israel has severely limited aid during its devastating war in the blockaded Palestinian enclave.

The current aid distribution system, supported by the US and Israel, has faced international condemnation, especially over the Palestinian lives lost at the distribution sites.

According to new figures from the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, more than 700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops and private contractors attempting to obtain food in the enclave since late May.

Around 5,000 Palestinians seeking aid have been wounded in almost daily shootings during aid distributions, the Ministry added.

This has spurred renewed condemnation of the US and Israeli-backed aid scheme.

The UN aid agency has called GHF's aid distribution as ""an abomination"" and ""a death trap costing more lives than it saves.""

UN and private aid groups have refused to collaborate with GHF, citing breaches of humanitarian principles. They accuse US and its ally Israel of controlling who receives aid in the devastated enclave.

GHF has admitted to reports of recent violence, but claims they occurred outside its operational area, despite close coordination with the Israeli military.

Sticking point in truce talks

But Bruce sought to defend the aid group, saying, ""It is now undeniable. This is the format that works, and others… should implement it.""

""There is no excuse to stand on the sidelines either because of envy or because of a political consideration because all of this transcends those things.""

Two former UN special rapporteurs, Richard Falk and Hilal Elver, have said the GHF's operations and the violence inflicted on Palestinians at its aid sites are ""war crimes"" and ""crimes against humanity.""

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) and more than 170 humanitarian groups – including Amnesty International, Oxfam, and Doctors Without Borders – have signed a joint statement calling for the immediate closure of GHF and the return to UN-led coordination mechanisms.

Aid distribution has also become one of the sticking points in talks over a potential US-backed 60-day truce deal between Israel and Hamas.

While US officials are suggesting a truce deal is imminent, Hamas has stated it has agreed to release 10 Israeli captives as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire but also warned that ongoing talks were ""tough"" due to Israel's ""intransigence"".

On Wednesday the Palestinian resistance group said the talks, spearheaded by key mediators Qatar and the US, have several sticking points, including the flow of desperately needed aid, withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and ""genuine guarantees for a permanent ceasefire"".

In an interview with Austrian newspaper Die Presse, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar noted ""progress"" in proximity talks, but conceded resolving ""all complex issues"" may require ""a few more days."""

A more powerful ""Heavy"" version of Grok, available for $300 a month, lets multiple AI agents collaborate on problems. There's a new voice mode, too, designed to sound more natural. It struggled when prompted to deliver an opera about Diet Coke.

No review or transparency report

But for all the bombast, there was no mention of what had happened the day before: the previous version of Grok had gone off the rails.

Grok 3 briefly went rogue, posting remarks ranging from deeply insensitive to factually absurd and antisemitic.

The posts were subsequently taken down by X. While xAI issued a statement, Musk, in typical fashion, deflected. The bot was ""too eager to please,"" he wrote, and would be ""fixed.""

Then, less than 24 hours later, Grok 4 arrived — framed not as a reset, but as a leap forward.

In the rush to outpace rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic, Musk seems to be betting on frequency over stability.

A coding-focused model is promised for August, a multimodal agent in September, and a video-generating model in October. It's an AI arms race, and Musk has his foot pinned to the accelerator.

However, the cost of that speed is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.

There was no technical report accompanying Grok 4's release. No published benchmark data. No independent review.

Where companies like OpenAI and Google offer detailed transparency reports, outlining what their models can do, and crucially, what they can't, xAI prefers a livestream and a few slide decks. Even those were short on specifics.

While Grok's meltdown this week wasn't entirely surprising to those watching closely, xAI's response, essentially to increase pre-post moderation, raises more questions than it answers.

Who decides what gets through? How will oversight evolve as the model becomes more complex and more autonomous?

And how exactly does ""truth-seeking"" work when deployed on a platform that regularly amplifies conspiracy theories?

""Grok 4 is a postgrad-level in everything,"" Musk said during an hour-long live broadcast.

At $30 a month for standard access, Grok 4 is priced to compete with other consumer-facing AI tools. But xAI's ambitions stretch far beyond monthly subscriptions.

The company is pitching its technology to businesses, governments, and advertisers. Public filings reveal billions raised through venture capital and debt. A new data centre — Colossus — is under construction in Tennessee.

In that context, Grok isn't just a chatbot. It's a flagship product in an unfolding commercial strategy. But whether it's stable enough or trusted enough to serve serious institutional clients is far from clear.

Musk's messaging doesn't help. During the livestream, he veered from calling current AI tools ""primitive"" to claiming Grok could help discover new physics ""later this year.""

There was talk of usefulness, common sense, and honour — values, Musk said, ""you’d want to instill in a child."" The metaphor sat awkwardly next to Tuesday’s outrageous outputs.

It's also worth noting what Musk didn't say. Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, quietly announced her departure just hours before the Grok 4 launch. No reason was given. The release Grok 4 model is more than just a new spectacle.

What's being optimised here isn't just AI performance. It's attention and a loop that rewards disruption. For Musk, that loop is both strategy and instinct.Whether Grok 4 is ""smarter"" than its peers remains to be seen. Whether it's going to be safer, more stable, or more useful — those questions have not been addressed. Musk, ever fond of grand analogies, framed Grok 4 in characteristically dramatic terms: ""You can think of AI as this super genius child that ultimately will outsmart you."""

Senior DHS investigations official Peter Hatch testified on the third day of a trial in the city of Boston on Wednesday that the majority of student protester names flagged for agency review were sourced from Canary Mission, NBC News reported.

The anonymous organisation known as Canary Mission operates a detailed online database that targets students, professors and others it falsely accuses of holding ""anti-Semitic"" views.

Canary Mission said in an email to NBC News that it has not collaborated with the DHS, emphasising that its database is publicly accessible.

""We have had no contact with this administration or the previous administration,"" it said.

The plaintiffs in the trial, including the Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors, the Middle East Studies Association and three other academic organizations, argue that the deportations infringed on First Amendment rights of the US Constitution.

US District Judge William Young pressed Hatch on how student names were provided to the agency.

'More than 75 percent' of names

Hatch explained that a ""tiger team"" of analysts was formed, pulling personnel from the counterterrorism unit, to assess student protesters for potential national security risks.

He said the team was directed to examine the website’s database, but ""Canary Mission is not part of the US government"" and ""we do not work with the individuals who create the website.""

The Middle East Studies Association of North America stated that, beyond accusations of doxxing and harassment, the site has also been accused of making personal attacks that portray pro-Palestine and anti-Gaza genocide activists as being in ""support of terrorism.""

""During the deposition, Hatch testified that 'more than 75 percent' of the names of student protesters his agency was asked to probe came from the website,"" CNN reported.

Hatch stated that the list from the Canary Mission website contained over 5,000 people, which analysts from his Office of Intelligence and Analysis had to review, CNN added.

Hatch reportedly stated Canary Mission was the most inclusive student group, though not the only one, with some students appearing in multiple sources."

""I echoed what the president (Donald Trump) said, both a disappointment and frustration at the lack of progress,"" Rubio told reporters on Thursday after the meeting with Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the ASEAN gathering in Malaysia.

It was their second in-person meeting, at a time when Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Russian President Vladimir Putin as the war in Ukraine drags on.

Russian drones and missiles bore down on the Ukrainian capital on Thursday, as escalating Russian attacks have strained Ukrainian air defences, forcing thousands into bomb shelters overnight.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia had launched 18 missiles and around 400 drones in an attack that primarily targeted the capital Kiev.

There was no comment from Moscow, which the previous night launched a record 728 drones at its neighbour.

On Tuesday, a day after ordering a resumption of deliveries of US defensive weapons to Ukraine, Trump was unusually critical, saying Putin's statements on moving towards peace were ""meaningless"".

Trump has also said he is considering supporting a bill that would impose steep sanctions on Russia, including 500 percent tariffs on nations that buy Russian oil, gas, uranium or other exports.

Rubio and Lavrov first met in Saudi Arabia in February as part of Trump's effort to re-establish relations and help negotiate an end to the war.

The Kremlin said on Wednesday it was relaxed about Trump's criticism and would keep trying to fix ""broken"" relations with Washington.

7/10/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/2554fbaaa057,Explained: How Bosnian Serbs tried to cover up the Srebrenica genocideSerbian forces didn’t just carry out genocide in Srebrenica—they worked methodically to hide it. Here is how.,"Thirty years ago, ethnic Bosnian Serb forces led by now-disgraced general Ratko Mladic entered Srebrenica and killed more than 8,000 Muslim Bosniak men and boys.

This town, just a few hundred kilometres from today’s Sarajevo, was supposed to be a “demilitarised safe zone” under the protection of the United Nations during the Bosnian War.

Despite its UN-protected status, how did a genocide happen here – planned and executed with ruthless efficiency and in full sight of international forces?

Moreover, how is it that even after three decades, the exact number of victims is yet to be ascertained, and their mortal remains still have not been accounted for?

This is the story behind the questions, revealing chilling Serbian tactics to cover up the genocide?

The UN’s peace promise, and its failure

On July 11, 1995, Ratko Mladic recorded a video with his armed soldiers as they marched into Srebrenica.

“Here we are, on July 11, 1995, in Serbian Srebrenica, just before a great Serb holy day. We give this town to the Serb nation. Remembering the uprising against the Turks, the time has come to take revenge on the Muslims,” he was heard saying in the video.

Dutch peacekeepers under General Thom Karremans faced intense Serb shelling. Finally, the Serbs captured 55 UN troops, and Karremans agreed to hand over some 25,000 Bosniaks who had sought refuge at a UN compound in the village of Potocari, where they were told they’d be safe and protected.

Despite being mandated to protect Srebrenica as a UN-declared “safe zone,” the Dutch peacekeepers offered no resistance when ethnic Bosnian Serb forces arrived.

Instead, women and children were put on buses and sent away to Tuzla, about 120km away from Sarajevo. Men and any boy over 15 were left behind — to be executed and buried in mass graves.

Outnumbered and under strict orders not to resist, the UN peacekeepers watched as the Bosniak civilians were taken away to be massacred.

Engineering a genocide needs a concrete plan

Executing over 8,000 people in a matter of days required military planning, coordination, and resources.

Bosnian Serb forces organised the transport of Bosniak men using buses and trucks, moving them from collection points near Srebrenica to remote execution sites, including warehouses, fields, schools, and farm buildings.

At these locations, civilians were killed in groups of dozens or even hundreds. In one case, more than 1,000 men were shot in a single night. Heavy machinery—particularly bulldozers—was pre-positioned to dig mass graves quickly. Some sites were prepared in advance of the massacre.

Military engineers covered the graves fast to hide the evidence. Satellite images, intercepted communications, and witness accounts all confirm this was a carefully planned operation—not a chaotic slaughter.

After the war ended in 1995, forensic teams have since found over 90 mass grave sites. However, it was hard to identify the victims as the bodies were not whole.

This, as a part of the systematic genocide, comes forward as the third stage: secondary and even tertiary graves.

A Bosniak mother grieving for her loved ones.

How the bodies were fragmented and hid

When international pressure mounted and NATO began conducting aerial surveillance after the fall of Srebrenica, Bosnian Serb forces initiated a large-scale cover-up.

In the weeks and months after the massacre, primary mass graves were reopened with bulldozers, the bodies exhumed, and the remains transported to new sites, often dozens of kilometres away.

This process fragmented and scattered the human remains, intentionally destroying forensic evidence and making victim identification much harder.

Forensic teams later documented more than 90 mass grave sites, many of them secondary or tertiary graves containing commingled, incomplete remains.

Victims’ bodies were buried, then dug up again and transferred by trucks and mechanical diggers to several “secondary” and even “tertiary” mass graves, each one further away from where they were originally buried.

Last stage of genocide: Breaking the family chain

The genocide against Muslim Bosniaks in Srebrenica was not limited to mass executions. Serbian forces used systematic sexual violence against Bosniak women as a deliberate tool of terror and ethnic cleansing.

Women were abducted, detained, and subjected to widespread rape in detention camps and makeshift prisons in and around Tuzla and other areas.

“For a person to be able to exist, they need to know that their life, mind, property, lineage, and faith are secure. When you look at these five dimensions, the Srebrenica genocide was an intentional act that targeted all areas of human existence,” Bosniak psychologist Semiha Bahadir tells TRT World.

“What made the Bosnian War, or the Srebrenica genocide, so distinct was its aim to prevent the continuity of a people.”

During the Bosnian war, Serbian forces forced Bosniak women to give birth, creating an imposed link to the perpetrator and destroying hope for the future, Bahadir says.

This deliberate use of sexual violence aimed to break the generational chain—leaving deep trauma and ensuring that even those who survived would carry the scars of genocide far into the future.

According to Bahadir, even today, asking those born during the war about their date or place of birth is seen as a form of “cruelty and oppression.”

“It is rarely asked, because such questions can carry painful, harmful messages,” she said.

Still no graves for over a thousand

The Bosnian War ended with the Dayton Agreement in December 1995.

The prosecution for the atrocities committed in Srebrenica could only begin after the war ended and systematic exhumations of mass graves began in 1996, providing the forensic evidence needed for trials.

Since then, the Hague Tribunal, Bosnia’s state court, and the courts of Serbia and Croatia have sentenced 47 people to over 700 years in prison, plus four life sentences, for genocide and related crimes.

Yet today, many families are still searching for even a single bone or finger to bury.

Thirty years on, burials continue each year.

Identifying remains relies on painstaking DNA analysis, as bodies were often scattered in secondary mass graves to conceal the crime.

Relatives hold onto the hope of finding at least part of their loved ones so they can finally bury them.

As a Bosniak mother Hajra Catic, says, “I live for the day when at least a little finger is found, so he can have his grave. If he does not have a grave, people will say he never existed”.

The mother had searched for her son Nihad Catic’s remains for the past three decades.

At this year’s 30th anniversary commemoration on 11 July at the Potocari Memorial Cemetery, seven victims will finally be laid to rest.

The seven to be buried this year are: Senajid Avdic, Hariz Mujic, Fata Bektic, Hasib Omerovic, Sejdalija Alic, Rifet Gabeljic, and Amir Mujcic.

The youngest among them, Senajid Avdic and Hariz Mujic, were only 19 when killed by Serbian forces.

Academics accuse German govt of complicity in Gaza genocideIn a searing open letter, dozens of German scholars denounce Berlin’s support for Israel’s genocide in Gaza and demand an end to state repression of pro-Palestinian voices.","More than 70 German academics from various disciplines have issued a powerful open letter to the German federal government, accusing the German government of aiding and abetting the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.

The signatories, who include professors from leading universities across Germany and Europe, demand immediate political, economic, and legal action to hold Israel accountable, and to stop what they describe as Berlin’s growing complicity in one of the greatest crimes of the 21st century.

""For 20 months, Germany has been supporting (politically, financially, and militarily) … the extermination and expulsion of the Palestinian population,” the letter states.

Published on June 21 and addressed to top government officials including Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, the letter comes at a time of intensifying global legal scrutiny of Israeli war crimes in Gaza.

“As long as you... refuse to acknowledge this reality and take appropriate action, you... will remain complicit in this crime.”

The letter references the International Court of Justice (ICJ)’s ruling that it is plausible that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, citing over 55,000 official deaths and an estimated 250,000 direct and indirect victims due to Israel’s military operations and blockade. These include the collapse of healthcare and water infrastructure, deliberate starvation policies, and widespread displacement.

The authors reject the framing of these actions as self-defence, asserting instead that they reflect a longstanding goal of displacing Palestinians from their land, not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank.

“For 20 months, we have been witnessing this horrendous genocide ""live"" every day, while German politics keeps on discussing and acting as if detached from it.”

The academics call for a full arms embargo on Israel, a review of all diplomatic and economic ties, and the recognition of Palestinian statehood. They urge sanctions and the suspension of agreements that support occupation, and demand Germany support the ICJ and ICC in prosecuting war crimes.

The signatories argue that Germany’s stance undermines the very international legal system established after World War II in response to German atrocities.

But beyond the urgent calls for state accountability, the letter also signals a deeper rupture within German academia, a space where critical voices have long been silenced under the weight of historical guilt and institutional red lines.

The scholars point to a repressive climate in which public criticism of Israel is frequently equated with antisemitism, events are cancelled, and student-led protests face criminalisation.

“We demand an immediate end to the restrictions on academic freedom and freedom of speech in Germany,” the letter reads, warning that the suppression of dissent not only undermines democracy but contributes to Germany’s ongoing complicity.

Bravo to the German academics who have had it with Germany’s complicity in Israel’s genocide against Palestinians, Lemkin Institute for Genocide Prevention posted on X.

Full arms embargo, suspension of relations

Among the specific demands: a full arms embargo on Israel, suspension of diplomatic and trade ties, and unconditional recognition of Palestinian self-determination.

The letter also urges the German government to support the work of the ICJ and the International Criminal Court (ICC), which last year issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, warrants Berlin has signalled it may not enforce.

The letter reflects mounting unease even within the German state itself.

Last October, nearly 600 civil servants from various ministries signed an open letter stating that “Israel is committing crimes in Gaza that are in clear contradiction to international law and thus to the German Constitution.”

The academics’ current statement builds on that momentum, but its publication also highlights the cost of speaking out.

“Critical voices on Israel’s actions and its occupation are being defamed using scientifically questionable definitions of antisemitism,” the letter states.

These conditions, they argue, are part of a broader political trend that erodes Germany’s obligations under international law, including its responsibility to prevent and punish genocide as a signatory of the UN Genocide Convention and the Rome Statute.

In calling for international protection for Palestinians, including safe zones, medical evacuations, and the admission of vulnerable refugees, the letter shifts the moral responsibility squarely back onto Berlin.

“Germany bears a special responsibility,” the signatories write, “particularly toward the injured, the sick, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and the traumatised.”"

European lawmakers will vote on the rare challenge pushed by a far-right faction against the European Commission president at around midday in Strasbourg.

Addressing parliament this week, von der Leyen dismissed the no-confidence motion as a conspiracy theory-laden attempt to divide Europe, dismissing its supporters as ""anti-vaxxers"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin apologists.

She urged lawmakers to renew confidence in her commission, arguing Europe needed to show unity in the face of various challenges, from US trade talks to Russia's war in Ukraine.

The no-confidence motion was initiated by Romanian far-right lawmaker Gheorghe Piperea.

He accuses von der Leyen of a lack of transparency over text messages she sent to the head of the Pfizer pharmaceutical giant when negotiating Covid vaccines.

The commission's failure to release the messages, the focus of multiple court cases, has given weight to critics who accuse its boss of centralised and opaque decision-making.

That is also a growing refrain from the commission chief's traditional allies on the left and centre, who have used the vote to air their grievances.

A major complaint is that von der Leyen's centre-right camp has increasingly teamed up with the far-right to further its agenda, most notably to roll back environmental rules.

Centrist leader Valerie Hayer told parliament this week that von der Leyen's commission was ""too centralised and sclerotic"" before warning that ""nothing can be taken for granted"".

""Pfizergate"" aside, Romania's Piperea accuses the commission of interfering in his country's recent presidential election, in which pro-European Nicusor Dan narrowly beat EU critic and nationalist George Simion.

That vote came after Romania's constitutional court scrapped an initial ballot over allegations of Russian interference and massive social media promotion of the far-right frontrunner, who was barred from standing again.

Piperea's challenge is unlikely to succeed.

It has support from some groups on the left and part of the far right, including the party of Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban.

""Time to go,"" Orban tweeted on Wednesday alongside a photo of von der Leyen.

But Piperea's group, the ECR, is split. Its largest faction, the party of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, said it would back the EU chief.

The two largest groups in parliament, the centre-right EPP and the centre-left Socialists and Democrats, have also flatly rejected the challenge, which needs two-thirds of votes cast, representing a majority of all lawmakers to pass."

That stray post has now morphed into a storm engulfing Big Tech and diaspora politics in the US.Maguire labeled Mamdani, 33, a Muslim, democratic socialist born to Indian parents, as an ""Islamist"" pursuing an ""Islamist agenda.""

The Bay Area tech bro, who partners with Sequoia ($85 billion in assets under management), went further, declaring that Mamdani ""comes from a culture that lies about everything"" and adding ominously, ""It's literally a virtue to lie if it advances his Islamist agenda"".

Mamdani's parents are of South Asian origin. His father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a widely regarded Columbia professor of Gujarati extraction, while his mother, Meera Nair, a filmmaker, is originally from Punjab in India.

What followed Maguire's slander was a cascade of condemnation from both Muslim Americans as well as Hindu nationalists, who, it is worth noting, have long been contributing to anti-Muslim sentiments and supremacist ideas in the US.

Old stereotypes, new dangers

There was a stir in the hallowed tech world, also. Within 48 hours, nearly 600 leading tech founders and executives had signed an open letter calling for remedial action by Sequoia, including a public apology, an independent investigation, a zero-tolerance hate-speech policy, and a hotline for reports of discrimination.

Three founders of startups that have scaled the hierarchy through the famed accelerator programme Y Combinator added their names to the letter.

Signators have called Maguire's language ""a deliberate, inflammatory attack that promotes dangerous anti‑Muslim stereotypes"", underscoring how the Internet-fuelled echo chamber had amplified the damage.

Hisham Al‑Falih, the CEO of Lean Technologies, a leading Middle-Eastern tech startup, told Bloomberg that Maguire's post was ""a sweeping and harmful generalisation of Muslims, but part of a broader pattern of Islamophobic rhetoric that has no place in our industry"".

For Muslims, these were familiar tropes: portraying a global faith as extreme, reinforcing long-standing and debunked biases.

What made the outrage particularly unusual was who else found Maguire's post offensive — sections of the Hindu nationalist movement who took issue with his sweeping statement about ""culture.""

Within the digital realm of the Hindutva far-right, the backlash reverberated powerfully across forums and social media platforms.The push back was quick, as has been the case in previous instances, when nationalists have found their identity being insulted or misrepresented.

One right-wing voice on X protested: ""This man called the entire Indian culture a lie."" For many on the Hindu right, rarely sympathetic to Mamdani, Maguire's sweeping generalisation appeared to smudge Indian identity itself, something tethered to the Hindutva ideal.

That these two ideological poles, Muslim-Americans and Hindu far-right, shared outrage over a contemporary issue highlights the strange unity that Maguire's words created. While one side saw Islamophobia, the other saw cultural defamation. Both saw identity under attack.

In the aftermath, Maguire published a nearly 30-minute video on X explaining his post, saying clearly: ""To any Muslim that is not an Islamist, and to any Indian that took offense to this tweet, I am very, very sorry.""

He stressed that ""Islamist"" referred to a political ideology, not religion.

For many Muslim Americans, it was an influential, white man from Silicon Valley who had resorted to cheap Islamophobia, labelling everything as political and suspect. Muslim tech leaders were also quick to stress that this wasn't merely a critique of Mamdani; it was a false claim conflating identity with ideology.

For far-right Hindu groups, it was equally incendiary. Maguire had tarred Indian heritage by association, disrespecting a culture already faced with diaspora anxieties. Shockwave in Silicon Valley

Within Sequoia, concern followed swiftly.

The open letter from tech leaders included signatories like Hosam Arab (Tabby CEO) and Ahmed Sabbah (Telda), calling on the firm to act by July 14 or ""proceed with broader public disclosure, media outreach and mobilising our networks"".Maguire has ""a documented pattern of anti-Muslim rhetoric over the past two years"" and ""caused significant harm to the global tech community,"" the letter noted.

Prominent Indian-origin tech leaders like Ankur Shah (Straiker), Neil Gehani (Lumara), Nikhil Dixit (Arbor), and Rajesh S Parmar (Indelible) were also among the signatories to the letter condemning Maguire's remarks.

The ideological tug-of-war in Silicon Valley has highlighted polarisation, as much ideological as technological, underscoring how private sector speech can trigger outsized public reaction in digital societies.

With July 14 looming, Sequoia will decide whether to take action."

""After many previous requests to hand over relevant information concerning foreign students, DHS will now send subpoenas forcing Harvard to comply,"" the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a statement on Wednesday.

Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that ""Harvard, like other universities, has allowed foreign students to abuse their visa privileges and advocate for violence and terrorism on campus.""

The subpoena demands that Harvard turn over ""relevant records, communications, and other documents relevant to the enforcement of immigration laws since January 1, 2020,"" according to the statement.

Harvard did not respond to a request for comment.

Since being sworn in again in January, President Donald Trump has targeted top US universities over false claims they are politically biased towards anti-Jewish hate and ""woke"" politics.

Trump has waged a political and economic campaign against Harvard, stripping it of funds and demanding extensive records linked to foreign students, whom it has repeatedly attempted to block the prestigious university from enrolling and hosting.

Harvard, like several other universities, was swept by a wave of student protests against Israel's genocide in Gaza.

Israel has been carrying out a systematic annihilation campaign in Gaza since October 2023. Palestinians have recorded killings of nearly 60,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children.

Approximately 11,000 Palestinians are feared buried under the rubble of destroyed homes, says WAFA, Palestine's official news agency.

Experts suggest the true death toll in Gaza may far exceed official reports, potentially reaching approximately 200,000.

Trump has made the question of student protest, particularly by foreign scholars, a flashpoint political issue.

A proclamation issued by the White House last month sought to bar most new international students at Harvard from entering the country, and said existing foreign enrollees risked having their visas terminated.

Harvard challenged the move in court and a judge blocked the administration from enforcing the policy.

International students at Harvard, who accounted for 27 percent of total enrollment in the 2024-2025 academic year, are a major source of income for the Ivy League institution.

The government already cut around $3.2 billion of federal grants and contracts benefiting Harvard and pledged to exclude the Cambridge, Massachusetts, institution from any future federal funding.

Harvard has been at the forefront of Trump's campaign against top universities after it defied his calls to submit to oversight of its curriculum, staffing, student recruitment and ""viewpoint diversity.""

Unlike Harvard, several top institutions — including New York's Columbia University — have already bowed to far-reaching demands from the Trump administration."

A coalition of 10 major trade unions that represent labourers and several other groups that speak for farmers and rural workers called for the one-day industrial action, dubbing it Bharat Bandh, “Shut Down India.”

The strikes pose fresh challenges for Modi’s efforts to attract foreign companies by easing labour laws to streamline business operations and boost productivity.

Unions that helped organise the strikes say that coal mining operations were halted in several states, while some trains came to a grinding halt as protestors blocked the network, and that banks, insurance companies, and supermarkets were disrupted.

The Associated Press reported that the eastern city of Kolkata saw protestors walking in a rally at a local railway station, some shouting slogans against the government and burning an effigy of Modi.

In the financial capital, Mumbai, bank employees shouted slogans against the privatisation of state-run banks.

Indian workers go on a daylong nationwide strike against Modi's economic reforms

The Press Trust of India reported that traffic in eastern India’s Odisha state was halted in some areas, while in the southern state of Kerala, shops, offices, and schools remained closed, with roads looking deserted.

The government hasn’t formally commented on the workers’ strike. It usually dismisses assertions made by these unions.

The workers' demands include higher wages, halting privatisation of state-run companies, withdrawal of new labour laws, and filling vacancies in the government sector.

The farmers' groups also want the government to increase the minimum purchase price for crops such as wheat and rice.

Modi's government has opened some sectors of the Indian economy to foreign direct investments and offered billions of dollars in financial incentives to attract local manufacturing.

It has also aimed to bridge the budget deficit with a drive to privatise ‘loss-making’ state-run companies and unveiled new labour laws that promise workers higher statutory minimum wages, social security, and healthcare.

However, the trade unions aren’t convinced and want the new laws to be scrapped.

“The government intends to suppress workers in the name of ease of doing business through labour reforms,” said Amarjeet Kaur, general secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress, a prominent union taking part in the strike.

Coal mining operations in most states have come to a halt.

Presidents of five African nations, Senegal, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, and Gabon, will meet in the executive mansion's State Dining Room to discuss trade, investment, and security, among other topics, officials told AFP.

But few concrete details have emerged as to the White House's intentions.

The meeting comes as the Trump administration is focused on tariffs and trade deals and as it seeks to ensure a stable supply of critical minerals.

But the five nations lack the extreme mineral wealth of other African countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The gathering takes place just days after the Trump administration celebrated the formal shuttering of the US foreign aid agency USAID, trumpeting the move as an end to the ""charity-based model.”

Officials from the five countries who spoke to AFP seemed keenly aware of the White House ethos.

Liberia's President Joseph Boakai accepted the invitation with an eye on no longer being ""solely an aid recipient,"" his press secretary Kula Fofana told AFP on Tuesday.

""Our interest is to look more to trade and engagement partners who will invest,"" she said.

Gabonese presidential spokesman Theophane Biyoghe said the meeting marked a chance for synergies ""centred around the industrialisation of our economy"".

US archrivals China and Russia have made major inroads into the region recently, including substantial investments by Beijing in a number of countries.

Moscow, meanwhile, has lent support to the region's newly formed Alliance of Sahel States (AES), comprised of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger.

The alliance states share borders with several of the countries at Wednesday's lunch.

Shortly before leaving for Washington, Guinea-Bissau President Umaro Sissoco Embalo described the visit to the press as ""very important"" for his country.

""Economically, this is a great opportunity opening for us,"" he declared, adding that he hoped his country would also benefit from ""the support"" the United States provides to other countries.

A number of world leaders have faced brutal political ambushes during White House visits.

Among them are Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

During a visit, Trump showed the South African leader a video of baseless claims of a ""white genocide"" being committed in his country.

While those episodes happened in front of cameras in the Oval Office, the five African presidents meeting Trump on Wednesday are so far not scheduled to appear before the press."

The remarks reportedly came during closed-door donor gatherings held in New York and Florida as part of Trump’s 2024 election campaign.

In the recordings, Trump said he warned Russian President Vladimir Putin against ‘invading’ Ukraine by threatening to destroy Moscow.

“I told Putin, ‘If you go into Ukraine, I will bomb Moscow flat. I have no choice,’” Trump is heard saying. “He didn’t believe me, but I think he believed me about 10 percent.”

Trump also claimed to have issued a similar warning to Chinese President Xi Jinping, threatening Beijing over any move on Taiwan.

“I told him, ‘If you attack Taiwan, we will bomb Beijing.’ He thought I was crazy. But we didn’t have any problems,” Trump said.

‘Gaza, Ukraine wars wouldn’t happen under me’

In the same recordings, Trump insisted that neither the Ukraine war nor the conflict in Gaza would have erupted had he remained in office instead of President Joe Biden.

“None of this would have happened if I were president,” he claimed.

Despite the ongoing negotiations, Israel continues its offensive on Gaza.

Comments on student protests

The leaked audio also includes Trump’s response to pro-Palestinian demonstrations on US university campuses.

He suggested deporting student protesters as a means of halting the unrest.

“I would deport the students who joined the protests,” Trump is heard saying."

The Ukrainian air force said on Wednesday that Russia attacked with 728 drones and 13 missiles, adding that its air defence systems intercepted 711 drones and that at least seven missiles were destroyed.

""This is a telling attack, and it comes precisely at a time when so many efforts have been made to achieve peace, to establish a ceasefire, and yet only Russia continues to rebuff them all,"" Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on social media.

He called for allies to step up sanctions on Russia, particularly targeting its energy sector, an important revenue stream for the Russian war chest.

""Our partners know how to apply pressure in a way that will force Russia to think about ending the war, not launching new strikes,"" Zelenskyy added.

The mayor of the western city of Lutsk, Igor Polishchuk, said fires had broken out at an ""enterprise"" and said no one had been reported killed or wounded.

The latest strike beat a previous Russian record of 550 drones and missiles set earlier this month.

It comes just after the United States U-turned on an announcement that it would reduce some weapons supplies to Ukraine.

In a statement on the X social media platform, Netanyahu stated that five Israeli soldiers were killed in the clashes in northern Gaza and that it was a difficult day for the Israeli people.

Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that they are determined to achieve the goals of the war they are continuing in Gaza.

Netanyahu stated that the war's goals are ""to ensure the release of all prisoners, to eliminate Hamas's military and administrative capacity, and to ensure that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel,"" adding that this means Hamas will no longer exist.

As a result, Netanyahu stated, all Israeli prisoners would be released, Hamas would be subdued and disbanded, Gaza would no longer pose a threat to Israel, and they have not yet completed their mission.

On the other hand, according to the Haaretz newspaper, US President Donald Trump’s Special Representative for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said in a statement that there were previously four points of disagreement regarding the ceasefire and prisoner exchange, and now only one remains.

Witkoff said they hope to reach an agreement leading to a 60-day ceasefire by the end of this week.

In a statement released yesterday, the Israeli army stated that five Israeli soldiers from the Netzah Yehuda Battalion of the Kfir Brigade were killed in Gaza.

The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) has reported, citing two officials who asked not to be named, that the US is considering sending additional resources to Ukraine.

Accordingly, the White House reportedly asked the Pentagon to prepare options for sending additional weapons, including the Patriot system, to Ukraine.

It was also stated that it was being investigated whether other countries could provide more Patriots to the Kiev administration.

A former Pentagon official claimed that the US has provided three Patriot systems to Ukraine, Germany three and other European countries one in total, but that not all of them are operational at the same time due to maintenance issues.

An official close to Trump said the White House is working with lawmakers to pass legislation supporting efforts to end the war.

Asked directly by TRT World's Baba Umar whether those countries are in the Middle East or outside of the region, US State Department Spokeswoman, Tammy Bruce, offered no names, instead describing the discussions as ""part of the ideas that have been discussed, or, contemplated.""

""There's a realisation,"" Bruce said, ""that the President (Donald Trump) has noted that… Gaza's strip [is not] an environment where one can live peacefully or safely, and in order to rebuild and to remake, people have to be safe.""

""Where we go with those conversations, I won't discuss the end result.""

Netanyahu is in the US for a multi-day trip, holding meetings in Washington, DC.

On Monday, Netanyahu said that Israel is working with the US to identify countries that could ""offer Palestinians a better future,"" as he met with US President Donald Trump at the White House.

""Israel is working with the US to find countries that will give Palestinians a better future,"" Netanyahu told reporters at the start of the meeting.

""We're working with the United States very closely about finding countries that will seek to realise what they always say, that they wanted to give the Palestinians a better future. I think we're getting close to finding several countries.""

Reflecting on the broader geopolitical moment, Bruce noted that ""after everything we've experienced… just five to six months — what has changed already?""

She referred to remarks made by the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, at Tuesday's Cabinet session, adding, ""It's been an astounding shift… not in a moment of a singular ceasefire, but changes in attitudes and what we expect.""

Bruce emphasised that regional players have a key role, saying, ""It's the regional partners, the nations in that region, who also have an overwhelming interest in the destruction, in the carnage ending.""

On whether any countries have agreed to take in Palestinians, or whether any specific proposals have been finalised, Bruce said only: ""We'll have to wait and see who is going to participate and how we make this a better future for the people.""

The statement comes amid deepening questions about Israel's long-term goals for Gaza — and growing concern over the fate of its displaced population.

Earlier this year, Trump floated the idea of relocating Palestinians and taking over the Gaza to turn it into the ""Riviera of the Middle East.""

""He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.""

Trump reiterated that he was ""very unhappy"" with Putin since their phone call last week made no progress on the Ukraine peace deal that the US president has pushed for since returning to power.

Asked about his interest in a bill proposed by the Senate for further sanctions on Russia, Trump said: ""I'm looking at it very strongly.""

Trump's criticism of Putin came a day after he said he would send more weapons to Ukraine, in a reversal of Washington's announcement last week that it was halting some arms shipments.

""Putin is not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people. So we're sending some defensive weapons and I've approved that,"" Trump said.

Trump has promised to immediately send 10 Patriot interceptors - anti-missile systems - to Ukraine, according to US news website Axios.

'No extensions' to tariff deadline

He said that he would not extend an August 1 deadline for higher US tariffs to take effect on dozens of economies, a day after he appeared to signal flexibility on the date.

While Trump imposed a sweeping 10 percent tariff on goods from almost all trading partners in April, higher rates customised to dozens of economies were unveiled, then halted until July 9.

He added that the levies would start being paid on August 1, in line with letters now being sent out to trading partners.

""No extensions will be granted,"" he posted on Truth Social. ""There will be no change.""

In his messages to foreign leaders, Trump warned of further escalation if there was retaliation against his levies.

At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump insisted that ""big money will start coming in on August 1.""

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent added at the meeting that tariff income could exceed $300 billion by year-end.

The Trump administration is under pressure to show results after promising a flurry of deals following the US president's tariff threats.

Trump said that Washington was ""probably two days off"" from sending the European Union a letter setting out the updated tariff rate that the bloc would face.

""They're very tough, but now they're being very nice to us, and we'll see what happens,"" he said. ""We are talking to them.""

Trump recently doubled US tariffs on imports of both metals to 50 percent while exempting the UK from this increase. But Washington could double the levy on UK steel and aluminium too starting Wednesday, if it determined that London had not complied with terms of their earlier deal."

In mid-June, the person contacted the ministers, a US governor and a member of Congress via the Signal messaging app and left voicemails for at least two of them, the cable said. In one instance, a text message was sent to invite the targeted person to communicate on Signal.

""The actor likely aimed to manipulate targeted individuals using AI-generated text and voice messages with the goal of gaining access to information or accounts,"" the cable said.

The Washington Post first reported the attempt.

""The State Department is aware of this incident and is currently investigating the matter,"" a senior State Department official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

""The Department takes seriously its responsibility to safeguard its information and continuously takes steps to improve the department’s cybersecurity posture to prevent future incidents,"" the official added.

The State Department cable, dated July 3, was sent to all diplomatic and consular posts and suggests that staff warn external partners about fake accounts and impersonations.

""There is no direct cyber threat to the department from this campaign, but information shared with a third party could be exposed if targeted individuals are compromised,"" it said.

Cyber actor associated with Russian intelligence

Neither the cable nor the US officials pointed to a suspected perpetrator, but the cable made reference to a second effort in April that was attributed to a Russia-linked hacker who conducted a phishing campaign targeting think-tanks, Eastern European activists and dissidents and former State Department officials.

In that attempt, the perpetrator copied a fake ""@state.gov"" email address on the messages as well as logos and branding used by State's Bureau of Diplomatic Technology, it said.

""The actor demonstrated extensive knowledge of the department's naming conventions and internal documentation,"" it said.

In that campaign, the person posed as a State Department official in messages sent to private Gmail accounts.

Trump's trade war will likely be high on the agenda as foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) gather in Kuala Lumpur for talks this week.

""We expressed concern over rising global trade tensions and growing uncertainties in the international economic landscape, particularly the unilateral actions relating to tariffs,"" ASEAN foreign ministers said on Tuesday, according to a draft Joint Communique.

Without directly naming the United States, the ministers said tariffs were ""counterproductive and risk exacerbating global economic fragmentation and pose complex challenges to ASEAN's economic stability and growth"".

Trump sent letters to 14 countries announcing that duties he had suspended in April would snap back - even more steeply - in three weeks.

Among those targeted were top trade partners Japan and South Korea, which each face 25 percent tariffs.

Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia and Myanmar - all members of the ASEAN - face duties ranging from 25 percent to 40 percent if they do not strike a deal with Washington by August 1.

Export-dependent Vietnam, which is also an ASEAN member, is one of only two countries to have reached a tentative agreement that spares it from Trump's measures.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will join his ASEAN counterparts on Thursday and Friday as part of his first trip to Asia since taking his post.

Rubio will likely tell leaders that the United States wanted to ""rebalance"" its trade relationships, a senior State Department official told reporters on condition of anonymity.

His visit coincides with that of his Russian and Chinese counterparts, Sergei Lavrov and Wang Yi.

But an analyst told AFP that Rubio is expected to play a placating role after Trump's latest tariff announcements.

""We can be hopeful for an uplifting message by Rubio, which reaffirms the importance of Southeast Asia to US foreign policy,"" said Mustafa Izzuddin, an international affairs analyst with consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore.

But he added: ""Deepening engagement of the US in Southeast Asia may be stymied by Trump's transactional approach to internationalism.""

The US leader had unveiled sweeping tariffs on imports on what he called ""Liberation Day"" on April 2, including a baseline 10 percent tariff on all countries.

But after turmoil on markets he quickly suspended all those above 10 percent for 90 days to allow for talks.

At a summit in late May, Southeast Asian leaders expressed their deep concern at Trump's protectionist offensive.

Malaysia's trade ministry said Tuesday it would continue negotiations to reach ""a balanced, mutually beneficial, and comprehensive trade agreement"".

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday after a two-day BRICS summit in Brazil, asked about criticisms directed at Israel in the summit statement, Hakan Fidan said: “Currently, the number of countries that continue to support Israel rhetorically is minimal, you can almost count them on one hand. The US remains at the forefront of those who do not oppose such (Israeli) policies.”

He added: “While nearly the entire international community rhetorically and politically condemns the events in Gaza and supports a two-state solution, the lack of concrete outcomes reveals a dysfunction in the system that must be acknowledged, corrected, and thoroughly discussed.”

Türkiye remains in close dialogue with all parties involved in ongoing ceasefire negotiations, he said, adding: “We met with Hamas multiple times before they responded to the latest proposal, conveying our views and the recommendations of our President (Recep Tayyip Erdogan).”

Fidan reiterated Ankara’s consistent position calling for an immediate ceasefire, facilitating humanitarian aid, and ensuring a peaceful resolution towards a two-state solution.

“Despite Israel’s escalation of the conflict into systematic massacre and genocide, we are ready to do everything possible to resolve this diplomatically and will work closely with our partners and allies,” he added.

Fidan said negotiations in Doha continue and that developments are expected to become clearer in the coming days.

Nuclear negotiations between Iran and US

On recent diplomatic efforts between Iran and the US, Fidan said he held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on the sidelines of the summit, discussing the status of the ceasefire and future steps.

“Currently, the ceasefire holds, and both sides are abiding by it. However, the prospects for resuming nuclear negotiations remain uncertain,” Fidan said, adding that he also recently discussed the issue with US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, noting that the US had conveyed certain views to the Iranian side.

Fidan added: “We hope a diplomatic solution can be found swiftly and that the conflict does not escalate further.”

Türkiye ready to host more Istanbul peace talks

On progress in the Istanbul peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, Fidan said that in the first two rounds: “These efforts produced unprecedented outcomes in the four-year war, including record-high prisoner exchanges and returns of bodies.” This shows how mediation diplomacy can yield positive results for humanity, he said.

Both parties have expressed appreciation for Türkiye’s efforts in the peace talks, he said, adding that whether a permanent or temporary ceasefire can be achieved, and whether this will happen through a leaders’ summit or negotiation teams, remains under discussion.

Stating that the sides hold different views, Fidan said: “Our advice is that by continuing to come to the table, starting positions can be brought closer together through different methods and more creative solutions, and we convey this to both parties.”

On the possibility of a summit involving Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, US President Donald Trump, and Turkish President Erdogan, Fidan said, “There is no objection in principle,” noting that all sides, including Putin, are open to meeting with their counterparts as hosted by Erdogan.

He said the Russian side insists on certain conditions being met before such talks can proceed, underlining that negotiating teams must resolve these issues and deliver concrete results.

“The Russians have expressed readiness for a third round of talks. We are now awaiting a response from the Ukrainian side and are maintaining contact with them,” Fidan said.

He also emphasised that international platforms such as BRICS – including longtime members Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, with several other countries recently joining – are a “tremendous” opportunity for bilateral talks.

“Türkiye’s international standing and approach lead to its voice being heard and sought after across many platforms. There is a demand from the international community to benefit from our experience and perspectives,” Fidan said, calling the BRICS summit productive.

He also said of the summit: “One of the leading topics was correcting the flaws in the current international system and reforming global governance.”

Underlining that artificial intelligence, a major topic in recent years, was also discussed at the summit, Fidan said sessions on climate change and health were also held.

Fidan underlined the importance of discussions of artificial intelligence, particularly the importance of maximising its benefits, the risk of some countries being left behind, the significant global disparity, and the technology’s rapid dominance.

“We have warned that the international system, organisations, and platforms should be very sensitive on this,” he added.

Fidan said these issues are important and that Türkiye places great emphasis on them.

Citing one of President Erdogan’s signature phrases, he explained: “When we say ‘the world is bigger than five,’ we are essentially expressing the injustice and inequality in the system in a single sentence. This has implications for many international issues, which were also addressed and discussed.”

Fidan said the importance of climate change and Türkiye’s strong commitment to its pledges on the issue were emphasised at the summit as well.

“What is concerning is that all the countries around the table are, unfortunately, seriously worried about this matter,” he said, citing how BRICS member states represent half of the world’s population and 40 percent of the global economy.

Fidan added: “Half of the countries gathered around the table are also members of the G20. Türkiye closely follows developments on every platform, and we will continue to engage with BRICS in this regard.”

He also extended his condolences to the families of 12 Turkish soldiers martyred by methane gas exposure during a search-and-sweep operation in a cave once used by terrorists in the Operation Claw-Lock zone in northern Iraq, and wished Allah’s mercy upon them.

“May the souls of our heroes rest in peace. We will continue to defend the homeland they entrusted to us with the utmost dedication,” he said."

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday adjusted an earlier tariff hike announced in April, lowering it slightly from 37 percent to 35 percent on Bangladeshi textile and garment imports. While still steep, it marks a slight reprieve from what industry leaders describe as a looming crisis.

“We are hopeful of a reduction,” said Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman, confirming that the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has sent a new draft for review. “Our national security adviser and commerce adviser are working on the issue in Washington,” he added.

Garment sector on edge

Bangladesh exported $8.36 billion worth of goods to the US in 2024—primarily clothing—while importing just $2.21 billion. President Trump has repeatedly cited this trade imbalance as justification for imposing tariffs that are more than double the existing 16 percent levied on cotton products.

The proposed tariffs have rattled an industry still recovering from last year’s student-led revolution that toppled the previous government. Interim Prime Minister Muhammad Yunus is expected to raise the matter directly with US officials.

“This is a big challenge for the garment sector,” said Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA). “We had expected something closer to 10-20 percent.”

Leading US brands such as Fruit of the Loom, Levi Strauss, and VF Corp (which owns Vans, Timberland, and The North Face) rely heavily on Bangladeshi suppliers. Industry stakeholders worry the tariff increase could make Bangladesh less competitive globally and trigger job losses.

Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel warned that the impact could be severe. “The new tariffs raise worries about job losses in Bangladesh as the US is its main export market,” he said. “Bangladesh needs to act quickly by engaging US importers to push for policy changes, resuming high-level trade talks, and highlighting the importance of its products.”

In a bid to ease trade tensions, Dhaka has proposed to purchase Boeing aircraft and increase imports of US wheat, cotton, and oil.

As the August 1 deadline set by the Trump administration nears, all eyes in Bangladesh’s export-driven economy remain fixed on Washington—hoping that diplomacy and trade ties can prevent a major blow to one of the world’s largest garment-producing nations."

It is the second time the US president has set a deadline after he postponed tariffs on almost all countries in April for 90 days.

Countries that have large trade imbalances with the United States have been key targets, including Japan ($68.5 billion surplus in 2024), South Korea ($66 billion), Thailand ($45.6 billion) and Indonesia ($17.9 billion).

Here is what Trump's letters mean for these countries:

South Korea, already burdened by levies on steel and automobiles, is facing a 25 percent tariff hike on its remaining exports to the United States, but is cautiously optimistic for a deal.

Washington ""hoped the two sides could reach an agreement before then (August 1)"", South Korea's national security adviser Wi Sung-lac said after meeting US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday.

South Korea, one of the world's biggest shipbuilders, agreed to ""coordinate closely"" with the United States to achieve ""tangible and mutually beneficial outcomes"", he said.

A close US ally and its biggest investor, Japan has to deal with a 25 percent levy on its key auto industry. It is facing similar tolls on other goods, up from 24 percent announced in April, but better than the ""30 percent, 35 percent or whatever the number is that we determine"" threatened by Trump last week.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told a cabinet meeting Tuesday that the tariff set out in the letter was ""genuinely regrettable"", local media reported.

The reason for not making a deal, he said, was ""the Japanese government has avoided making easy compromises, firmly demanding what should be demanded, protecting what should be protected, and has conducted rigorous negotiations"".

Trump has criticised Japan for not opening its market enough to US rice and vehicles.

The Japanese government says it is defending local farmers' interests and has taken a hardline approach to talks.

""We have no intention of negotiating at the expense of agriculture,"" Japan's tariffs envoy Ryosei Akazawa said Tuesday.

Indonesia, facing 32 percent tariffs, said it was optimistic of striking a deal as chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto headed to the United States to resume talks.

With several weeks breathing room, Jakarta was ""very optimistic about the negotiation"", presidential spokesman Hasan Nasbi said.

Indonesia plans to increase its agricultural and energy imports from the United States to finalise an agreement, Airlangga recently told AFP.

Indonesia already announced on Monday it had agreed to import at least one million tons of US wheat annually for the next five years, worth $1.25 billion.

Trump announced 49 percent tariffs on Cambodia in April, one of the highest levies in his blitz. Monday's letter to the country that hosts many Chinese owned factories, reduces this rate to 36 percent.

Prime Minister Hun Manet assured the White House of Cambodia's ""good faith"", with reduced tariffs on 19 categories of US products.

Myanmar and Laos, which face 40 percent tolls, rely on Chinese investments, while their supply chains are closely intertwined with Asia's largest economy.

Washington has repeatedly highlighted the risk of Chinese products passing through Southeast Asian countries to avoid US tariffs targeting China.

Thailand was told it faces 36 percent levies. Bangkok is offering more access to its market for US agricultural and industrial products, increasing its energy purchases, and boosting orders for Boeing airplanes.

Acting prime minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters Tuesday he wanted a ""better deal"", adding that ""the most important thing is that we maintain good relations with the US"".

Bangkok aims to reduce its US trade surplus by 70 percent within five years, achieving balance in seven to eight years, Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira recently told Bloomberg News.

Thai Airways could commit to purchasing up to 80 Boeing planes in the coming years, according to Bloomberg.

Malaysia faces a 25 percent tariff and the trade ministry said Tuesday it would continue negotiations to reach a ""balanced, mutually beneficial, and comprehensive trade agreement"".

The world's second-largest textile manufacturer is facing a 35 percent tariff on its goods but was hoping to sign an agreement by early July.

Textile and garment production accounts for about 80 percent of Bangladesh's exports, and supplies US brands including Vans, Timberland and The North Face.

Dhaka has proposed to buy Boeing planes and boost imports of US wheat, cotton and oil.

""We have finalised the terms,"" Commerce Ministry Secretary Mahbubur Rahman told AFP, adding that negotiators were set to meet Tuesday.

Kazakhstan (25 percent), South Africa (30 percent), Tunisia (25 percent), Serbia (35 percent), and Bosnia (30 percent) are among the other recipients of the letters made public by Trump on Monday."

Speaking at a government meeting, Ishiba said that bilateral talks will continue toward a mutually beneficial deal, according to the Tokyo-based Kyodo news agency.

On Monday, Trump announced that Washington would impose a 25 percent tariff on goods from Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia starting from August 1.

He signed an executive order that extends the date on which reciprocal tariffs will take effect to August 1.

The Japanese prime minister added his government will prioritise bilateral negotiations.

Malaysia to continue engaging US

Malaysia, meanwhile, said it will continue engaging the US in pursuit of a ""fair and balanced"" trade agreement following Washington’s decision to impose a 25 percent tariff on Malaysian goods.

The Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry said it values the longstanding economic partnership with the US and believes that open and fair trade supports growth and jobs in both countries, local English daily Malay Mail reported.

""These efforts are still ongoing and reflect Malaysia’s willingness to reach a fair and sustainable outcome for both parties,” the ministry said.

Kuala Lumpur also cautioned that unilateral actions could disrupt business operations, supply chains and investment flows.

Malaysia said it would take “all necessary steps” to protect local businesses, workers and consumers from the new measures.

South Korea to speed up tariff negotiations

South Korea on Tuesday said it will speed up tariff negotiations with the US to strike a ""mutually beneficial"" deal.

""The government views the US administration has suspended the imposition of reciprocal tariffs, including 25 percent duties for South Korea, until August 1, and we will work to accelerate negotiations with the US to swiftly resolve trade uncertainties,"" the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said in a statement.

""We will pursue domestic institutional improvements and regulatory reforms to address US trade deficits with Korea, while promoting a bilateral manufacturing renaissance partnership to advance our key industries,"" it added.

In the same vein, South Korea's National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac told US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Seoul hopes to hold a summit between Trump and President Lee Jae Myung at ""an early date,"" to ""advance a mutually beneficial outcome in all pending issues,"" the presidential office said in a statement.

During a meeting in Washington, Wi emphasised the need to advance tariff negotiations in a way that strengthens the bilateral alliance and expressed hope for continued cooperation between the two sides, the presidential office said.

Rubio, in return, shared the consensus and expressed hope that the two countries would remain in close communication to reach a trade agreement until the actual imposition of tariffs on August 1.

Bangladesh will have another round of talks with the US after imposition of a 35 percent tariff on Bangladeshi goods from August 1.

Bangladesh Commerce Adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin along with National Security Adviser Khalilur Rahman is in Washington, leading the country's trade talks with the US, an official statement said Tuesday."

On Monday, President Donald Trump began notifying trade partners of sharply higher US tariffs from August 1, after he delayed all but 10 percent of his April duties on most countries to give them time to strike deals with the world's largest economy.

China, initially singled out with tariffs exceeding 100 percent, has until August 12 to reach an agreement with the White House to keep Trump from reinstating additional import curbs imposed during tit-for-tat tariff exchanges in April and May.

""One conclusion is abundantly clear: dialogue and cooperation are the only correct path,"" the official People's Daily said in a commentary, referring to the exchanges in the current round of China-US trade tension.

The article was signed ""Zhong Sheng"", or ""Voice of China"", a term the paper uses to express views on foreign policy.

Reiterating Beijing's view that Trump's tariffs amount to ""bullying"", the paper added, ""Practice has proven that only by firmly upholding principled positions can one truly safeguard one's legitimate rights and interests.""

The remarks set the stage for another round of tariff war should Trump stick to what the ruling Communist Party's official daily said was ""a so-called 'final deadline.'""

The average US tariff on Chinese exports now stands at 51.1 percent, while the average Chinese duty on US goods is 32.6 percent, with both sides covering all their trade, the Peterson Institute for International Economics said.

The paper also took a swipe at regional economies that are considering striking tariff reduction deals with the United States that cut China out of their supply chains.

Last week, Vietnam secured a tariff reduction to 20 percent from 46 percent with a deal for goods ""transshipped"" through it, typically originating from China, to be subjected to a levy of 40 percent.

""China firmly opposes any side striking a deal that sacrifices Chinese interests in exchange for tariff concessions,"" the paper said.

""If such a situation arises, China will not accept it and will respond resolutely to protect its legitimate interests."""

“It cannot be that might should now be right,” Ramaphosa said on Monday during a press briefing in Rio de Janeiro. “There should never be vengeance or retribution against countries seeking cooperation and working to advance the interests of humanity.”

His comments came in response to Trump’s recent vow to introduce a 10 percent tariff on imports from countries that, in his words, “orient themselves along anti-American policies,” specifically referencing the BRICS economic bloc — comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — which has sought to expand its global influence.

‘BRICS is not a rival to UN or G20’

Ramaphosa dismissed the notion that BRICS is a threat to existing institutions, saying the bloc should be seen as one of several emerging centers of global power promoting development and good governance. “BRICS is not a rival to the UN or G20,” he said, calling the bloc’s latest joint declaration “a beautiful declaration” focused on global well-being.

He also confirmed that BRICS member states collectively condemned Israel’s “unilateral” strike on Iran and reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza to halt what he described as the “slaughter and genocide of the Palestinians.”

Reform the UN Security Council

Ramaphosa further emphasised the need for reform at the United Nations, particularly the Security Council, noting that calls from the Global South — especially Africa — are “gathering momentum.”

He argued that the global governance system, largely unchanged since World War II, must be modernised to reflect today’s realities.

On the trade front, Ramaphosa remained optimistic despite a looming deadline set by the Trump administration for ongoing trade negotiations. He said that South Africa’s Trade Ministry was actively engaging with its US counterparts following his visit to the White House in May.

“We’ve made a clear proposal and offer, which is under review,” he said. “Everything is negotiable — even deadlines.”

Tensions between US and South Africa

Tensions between Pretoria and Washington have escalated in recent months. In February, Trump issued an executive order slashing financial aid to South Africa, citing concerns over its land reform policies, closer ties with Iran, and its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice.

Trump has also drawn criticism for controversial comments alleging that white South African farmers are being targeted and killed — claims the South African government has rejected.

Still, Ramaphosa described his White House meeting with Trump as productive, saying it helped “reset” the bilateral relationship around trade amid “a turbulent geopolitical architecture.”"

The two-week non-jury trial that kicked off in Boston on Monday in the professors' case marks a rarity in the hundreds of lawsuits that have been filed nationally challenging Republican President Donald Trump's efforts to carry out mass deportations, slash spending and reshape the federal government.

In many of those cases, judges have issued quick rulings early on in the proceedings without any witnesses being called to testify.

But US District Judge William Young, an 84-year-old appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, in keeping with his long-standing practice instead ordered a trial in the professors' case, saying it was the ""best way to get at truth.""

The trial stems from a lawsuit filed in March by the American Association of University Professors and its chapters at Harvard, Rutgers and New York University, and the Middle East Studies Association, in which they argued the administration was chilling free speech on campuses in violation of the US.

Ramya Krishnan, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said during her opening statement the State Department and Department of Homeland Security were doing so after adopting a policy of revoking visas for non-citizen students and faculty who engaged in pro-Palestine advocacy and arresting, detaining and deporting them as well.

""The policy creates a cloud of fear for university communities, and it is at war with the First Amendment,"" said Krishnan, a lawyer at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.

She said the policy was adopted after Trump signed two executive orders in January directing the agencies to protect Americans from non-citizens who ""espouse hateful ideology"" and to combat anti-Semitism following protests that roiled college campuses after Israel launched its genocidal war in Gaza in October 2023.

Krishnan pointed to several high-profile arrests since those orders were signed, starting in March, when immigration authorities detained recent Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil, the first target of Trump's effort to deport non-citizen students with pro-Palestine or anti-Israel views.

Since then, she said, the administration has cancelled the visas of potentially hundreds of other students and scholars and arrested several of them, including Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student who was taken into custody by masked and plainclothes agents after co-writing an opinion piece criticising her school's response to Israel's genocide in Gaza.

In their cases and others, judges have ordered the release of students detained by immigration authorities after they argued the administration retaliated against them for their pro-Palestinian advocacy in violation of the free speech guarantees of the US Constitution's First Amendment.

""The government sought to deport these non-citizens in retaliation for their speech,"" Krishnan said.

Trump administration officials have frequently spoken about the efforts to target student protesters for visa revocations.

Justice Department attorney Victoria Santora said ""the reality is there is no ideological deportation policy, or anything like it, under any other name.""

She said instead, the Trump administration was lawfully executing its wide discretion to enforce immigration law and revoke visas in order to pursue the justifiable purpose of ensuring national security and protecting Jewish students.

""The plaintiffs are challenging nothing more than this administration's lawful enforcement of immigration laws,"" Santora said.

The trial will determine whether the administration has violated the plaintiffs' First Amendment free speech rights. If Young concludes it has, he will determine a remedy in a second phase of the case.

Young has described the lawsuit as ""an important free speech case.""

When under questioning about her position, Santora said there were ""nuances to the First Amendment,"" the judge sharply questioned what that means in this case.

""Political speech is at the very core of the First Amendment,"" he said."

Monday's protest, organised by American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) in collaboration with anti-war group CODEPINK and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), took place in front of Lafayette Park, just hours before Netanyahu was set to meet with US President Donald Trump at the White House.

Demonstrators slammed the Israeli leader's visit as a ""stain"" on US foreign policy.

Many held signs referencing an arrest warrant issued by The Hague-based International Criminal Court (ICC) for Netanyahu on charges of war crimes in Gaza.

""This is not a diplomatic visit. This is a disgrace,"" said Robert McCaw, Director of Government Affairs at CAIR.

""Every handshake, every deal, every photo op (with Netanyahu) with American leaders stains the hands of all Americans with the blood of children from Gaza.""

The protests came as Netanyahu arrived in Washington to meet with Trump.

Protesters held signs that read ""End the Gaza War. Save All Hostages,"" while many voiced frustration over what they described as Netanyahu's refusal to end the genocide and secure a hostage-prisoner deal.

Israel has been carrying out a genocide in Gaza since October 2023. Palestinians have recorded killings of more than 54,320 Palestinians, most of them women and children.

Some 11,000 Palestinians are feared buried under rubble of annihilated homes, according to Palestine's official WAFA news agency.

Experts, however, contend that the actual death toll significantly exceeds what the Gaza authorities have reported, estimating it could be around 200,000.

The ICC issued arrest warrants last November for Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.

""Judaism and Zionism are not the same. Judaism is a religion, while Zionism is a purely political movement""

'Judaism and Zionism are not the same'

""This moment is pivotal,"" said Osama Abu Irshaid, executive director of AMP.

""America is not a neutral party. Trump is not a mediator. Trump is a partner in this genocide. He has to bring himself to end this genocide, as he has to force Netanyahu to bring this genocide to an end.""

Abu Irshaid urged Trump to ""publicly and unequivocally demand"" a permanent and unconditional ceasefire from Netanyahu and to end what he described as ""vague diplomacy and half measures.""

CODEPINK co-founder Medea Benjamin underscored the growing disconnect between US politicians and public opinion.

""It is quite amazing that, despite the mainstream media, the majority of American people now do not support Israel.""

""It's all age groups, it's Republicans, Democrats, independents, it's Blacks, it's whites, it's all demographics in the United States. They don't want to keep sending money and bombs to Israel,"" she said.

Also joining the protest was Rabbi Dovid Feldman, who pushed back against accusations that criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic.

""This is not about anti-Semitism. This is about crimes taking place. Benjamin Netanyahu a war criminal wanted by the International Court,"" he said. ""Judaism and Zionism are not the same. Judaism is a religion, while Zionism is a purely political movement.""

Father of Israeli hostage joins protest

Among the protesters was the father of an Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza.

""Only Donald Trump can save my son,"" Yehuda Cohen said in an interview with Anadolu Agency, holding a photo of his 21-year-old son Nimrod Cohen.

In an appeal to the US president, who is set to receive Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later on Monday for in-person talks, Cohen asked he ""force Netanyahu to end the war and go for a hostage deal.""

Wearing a shirt that read ""Ceasefire and Hostage Deal Now,"" Cohen said he had been asking for a hostage deal and an end to the war in Gaza for more than a year.

""We are still asking that. This is the only way my son will be free.""

He criticised Netanyahu for putting his personal interests and political survival above the lives of the hostages.

""He's got right-wing extremists in his coalition who want the total occupation of the Gaza Strip. They want to rebuild settlements there and that's why they are threatening that they will withdraw from the coalition if we go for a ceasefire,"" Cohen said.

Noting Netanyahu's corruption trial in Israel, he accused the Israeli premier of ""doing everything to postpone this trial.""

""He knows that if he will lose his position as a prime minister, his trial will speed up and a verdict will come which will put him into jail.""

Hadar Susskind, president and CEO of the group New Jewish Narrative, told Anadolu Agency that the protest was organised in direct response to Netanyahu’s visit.

""We reached out to bring this group together today because Netanyahu is here meeting Trump,"" he said. ""We demand an end to the war, the return of all hostages, and sending in aid to the people of Gaza and an end to all of this.""

Asked if he believes a ceasefire deal could happen this week, Susskind said he remains cautiously optimistic.

""President Trump has said he wants to see it, and he has the capacity to pressure Netanyahu. President Trump can make it happen,"" he said. ""We need not just a temporary pause — but an end to this war."""
7/7/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/87b1841a4df1,How NYT's hit job on Zohran Mamdani spectacularly backfiredNew York Times faces blowback for using hacked college records in a story seen as legacy media's attempt to undermine Mamdani's mayoral bid just weeks before the elections.,"On July 3, The New York Times published what appeared to be a straightforward political expose. But by sunset, it had become the centre of a storm, not around its subject, Zohran Mamdani, but around The Times itself.

The controversial article focused on a detail from Mamdani's past: a college application he submitted in 2009 to Columbia University. Then 17, Mamdani, had checked two racial identity boxes — ""Asian"" and ""Black or African American."" He wasn't admitted to Columbia. The Times positioned this disclosure as potentially significant, noting that Mamdani identifies as an Indian Ugandan-American today, but not as Black.

Ordinarily, the story might have quietly faded into the news cycle, but the context in which it was published has triggered a backlash that continues to trend on social media in the US.

Mamdani, 33, is currently the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City and a sitting assemblyman from Queens. He was born in Uganda to South Asian parents and moved to New York at age seven. He became a US citizen in 2018. As a Muslim, democratic socialist, Mamdani has disrupted the traditional political power centres of the city.

The NYT article was framed as a factual look at his past — a ""routine"" piece of political scrutiny. But critics swiftly pointed out that the detail it focused on was sourced from a cache of hacked Columbia University admissions documents. Those documents had been leaked to The Times by an anonymous source described only as ""an academic critic of affirmative action.""

Within 24 hours of publication, that source was identified publicly.

Cremieux, as he was referred to in the article, was revealed by The Guardian to be Jordan Lasker, a Substack writer known for defending race science and promoting views linking race and intelligence.

Lasker's writings frequently cite studies that argue for racial hierarchies in IQ, and he has aligned himself with the far-right online ecosystem.

""Why would you promise him anonymity, especially when his views are already in the public record?"" asked Jane Kirtley, a professor of media ethics at the University of Minnesota, speaking to the Columbia Journalism Review (CJR).

""There's an element of manipulation here, and The Times should've seen it coming.""

Critics saw NYT's decision to publish the piece as not only ethically questionable but also politically motivated. The paper's editorial board, which no longer endorses local races, had earlier issued a scathing editorial about Mamdani's mayoral run, effectively urging voters not to support him. The publication of the college application story, just weeks before the Democratic primary, was widely interpreted as a coordinated effort to undermine a leading candidate the establishment fears.

Public figures were swift to respond. American political commentator and writer Keith Olbermann called the piece ""vile.""

Other noted media voices on X and Reddit accused The Times of laundering racist pseudoscience in the service of political smear.

The phrase ""NYT smear"" trended on X for three days.

Even inside The Times, there was dissent.

Jamelle Bouie, a much-respected columnist at the paper, posted criticisms of the piece before deleting them, reportedly under pressure due to the paper's social media rules.

The backlash spilled over into Mamdani's campaign. But not in the way The Times may have anticipated.

Donations surged, campaign organisers said. Small-dollar contributions spiked by over 20 percent in the three days after publication. Volunteers signed up at higher rates. Internal polling, shared with reporters, showed an uptick in support among young voters and among African and South Asian diaspora communities. In several interviews with local press, voters described The Times article as ""a distraction,"" ""desperate,"" and ""a reminder of who gets to control the narrative.""

""I don't have a problem with how he self-identifies,"" Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate for mayor running against Mamdani, told Fox News.

Mamdani himself said, ""I checked multiple boxes trying to capture the fullness of my background. Even though these boxes are constraining, I wanted my college application to reflect who I was.""

Critics say the real question is not about racial categories on a college form, but about power: who is allowed to navigate American identity with complexity, and who is punished for it.

For many, the story backfired not just because it lacked substance, but because it laid bare how legacy media still struggles to cover candidates who don’t fit the mould of traditional politics. Rather than paint Mamdani as dishonest, it reinforced his image as a target of elite discomfort — and helped galvanise his base.

In defending the piece, Patrick Healy, assistant managing editor for Standards and Trust at The Times, insisted the story was newsworthy.

""What matters most here is whether the information was true and factual — it was, confirmed by Mr Mamdani; that it was independently confirmed; and that it is relevant to the public,"" he told CJR.

But that defence has done little to slow the erosion of trust among The Times' younger and more progressive readers.

As the reader backlash thundered on, The Times quietly shuttered the comments section on the Mamdani piece — a silent concession that the storm wasn't passing.

The hit job by the NYT has exposed fault lines in the media ecosystem and how mainstream American journalism navigates the terrain between fact and fairness.

As Kirtley put it, ""You don't protect a source just because they handed you a document. You have to think about why they handed it to you in the first place."""

""In consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury, I hereby revoke the designation of al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (and other aliases) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in the notice dated June 23 and scheduled for publication Tuesday.

The revocation will take effect immediately upon publication.

HTS has been on the US Foreign Terrorist Organization list since 2018, when the group was added to the existing designation of its predecessor, the Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front.

Last December 8, Bashar Assad, who ruled Syria for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia after anti-regime groups captured Damascus in a swift offensive led by Hayat Tahrir al Sham.

A new transitional administration in Syria led by President Ahmed al Sharaa was formed in January.

Last month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to terminate the US sanctions on Syria.

In May, Trump announced at an investment forum in Riyadh that he would lift the “brutal and crippling” sanctions on Syria.

A day later, he held a landmark meeting with Sharaa in Saudi Arabia – the first meeting between the US and Syrian leaders in 25 years."

After more than 21 months of genocide in Gaza, Netanyahu is under intensifying international scrutiny, including an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for ""war crimes"" in the besieged Palestinian enclave.

Israel has been carrying out a genocide in Gaza since October 2023. Palestinians have recorded killings of more than 57,500 Palestinians, most of them women and children.

Some 11,000 Palestinians feared buried under rubble of annihilated homes, according to Palestine's official WAFA news agency.

Experts, however, contend that the actual death toll significantly exceeds what the Gaza authorities have reported, estimating it could be around 200,000.

At home, Netanyahu faces a volatile political landscape: mounting criticism over military failures, a stalled hostage crisis, corruption allegations, elections less than a year away, and a coalition dominated by far-right figures who threaten to collapse the regime if he agrees to a permanent ceasefire.

Israeli analyst and former negotiator Gershon Baskin told Anadolu Agency the Washington visit is part of a broader campaign to rehabilitate his image, and ""redeem himself after the failures of October 7.""

Apart from Gaza, the meeting is also expected to focus on regional issues such as Iran's nuclear programme, developments with Lebanon and Hezbollah, and expansion of the Abraham Accords.

Could there be a definitive ceasefire?

The top priority of the meeting is expected to be a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.

Reports suggest Israel has accepted the current proposal, under which Hamas would release about half of the captives over a 60-day period. Hamas has submitted a positive response, and on Saturday, Israel announced plans to send mediators to Qatar for indirect talks.

But analysts such as Ryan Bohl, senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at intelligence firm RANE Network, say Israel is unlikely to agree to a long-term truce.

""From Netanyahu's perspective, a temporary ceasefire is acceptable because it could get out some hostages … It would allow Israel's soldiers to get some rest from intensive combat. It would take some political pressure off of Netanyahu,"" he told Anadolu Agency.

He said the Israeli regime is likely to demand the right to resume offensives after 60 or 120 days. Unless Hamas goes into exile or surrenders, Israel will continue to try to erode the resistance group's capabilities.

""From Hamas' perspective, on the other hand, it's about buying time until the next Israeli elections,"" Bohl added, referring to the legislative elections scheduled to be held by October 27, 2026.

Trump, meanwhile, could benefit politically by framing a ceasefire as proof of his ability to ""end wars.""

""He wants to sell the narrative that he is ending conflicts,"" Bohl said. He believes the US could use military aid as leverage to force a breakthrough.

Baskin believes that whatever is to happen depends on the US president, as ""Netanyahu cannot say no to Trump.""

""Israel is dependent on the US,"" he said. ""If Trump is decisive and wants Netanyahu to end the war, the war will end.""

Baskin also noted that during a previous failed ceasefire attempt in March, Hamas claimed it had received assurances from the US that Israel would fully withdraw from Gaza.

""If that's true, what it means is that the 60-day ceasefire could become permanent,"" he said.

""Trump thinks that Netanyahu owes him,"" Eytan Gilboa, an expert on US-Israel affairs at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv, told AP news agency.

""And if Trump thinks that he needs to end the war In Gaza, then that is what he will need to do.""

West Bank annexation and two-state solution

Ahead of the meeting, 14 ministers from Netanyahu's Likud party called for the immediate annexation of the occupied West Bank.

When asked about US backing, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said last week the US ""stands with Israel and its decisions and how it views its own internal security.""

Bohl said annexation remains unlikely but noted that some on the Israeli far right may see it as an opportunity.

""Israel's far right buys the idea that 'we'll call it a permanent ceasefire while we annex the West Bank, absorb whatever backlash we're going to get from that, and then two years down the line, we'll resume the war in Gaza,'"" he said.

Baskin believes Trump may push Netanyahu to discuss his longer-term vision for Gaza and Palestine.

""I think that Trump will talk about the day after in Gaza, which has to include a wider political formula for moving the two-state solution forward or for addressing the Palestinian issue,"" he said.

During Trump's recent tour of the Middle East – where he did not visit Israel – Baskin noted that he discussed the question of Palestine and a two-state solution with leaders of Gulf countries.

Expansion of so-called Abraham Accords

Trump is also expected to push for expanding the so-called Abraham Accords, a series of agreements that normalised ties between Israel and Arab states.

""It is possible that Netanyahu tries to show that he's more constructive on the Abraham Accords by, for example, announcing a partial retrenchment of Israeli forces from southern Syria,"" said Bohl.

While he does not expect a full-scale normalisation announcement with Syria, Bohl said something ""concrete"" could emerge from the meeting.

He said the ultimate prize for both Trump and Netanyahu remains Saudi Arabia, whose officials have made it clear that normalisation depends on an end to the Gaza war and progress towards Palestinian statehood.

Given Riyadh's stance, Bohl said the US and Israeli leaders could push for some other sort of deal that would be less significant than complete normalisation.

Analysts also expect Iran and Lebanon to feature in Monday's discussions.

The US and Israel will discuss ""next steps on Iran's nuclear programme and assess what they need to do in that regard,"" said Bohl, adding that the talks will also likely cover the issue of ""Hezbollah’s disarmament.""

Netanyahu's legal woes and Trump's support

The meeting also comes as Trump continues to voice support for Netanyahu amid his ongoing corruption trial, calling the proceedings a ""witch hunt"" and attacking Israeli prosecutors.

The trial was recently delayed for classified security reasons, prompting speculation about US influence. But Bohl said any legal decisions remain in the hands of Israeli authorities.

Baskin offered similar insight.

""The trial has begun. It’s very difficult to end a trial in the middle unless there’s some kind of agreement for a deal, or if Netanyahu accepts responsibility and guilt,"" he explained.

""He can ask the president to give him amnesty to relieve him of the charges, but this is an internal Israeli process, so Trump really cannot intervene in that process.""

Netanyahu’s political survival on the line

Analysts say even if Netanyahu secures a ceasefire and hostage release, his political survival is far from assured.

""I think most Israelis have their minds made up about Netanyahu ... If the elections were held today, Netanyahu is finished,"" said Bohl.

He noted that many blame Netanyahu for the October 7 failures and accuse him of politicising the war.

""I think it’s very hard for him to come back from that, even if he successfully gets the hostages out,"" he added.

At the same time, Netanyahu runs the risk of his far-right partners breaking the coalition if there is a ceasefire, Bohl added.

If his far-right partners leave the government, Netanyahu could be forced to seek support from rivals like Benny Gantz.

""I think that would put a timer on the collapse of the Netanyahu government,"" he said. ""Because as soon as the hostages are out, I think Gantz would collapse the government and force elections to get rid of Netanyahu."""

The nation was shocked at the disaster over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, and forecasters warned that thunderstorms threatened more flooding over saturated ground.

""Camp Mystic is grieving the loss of 27 campers and counselors following the catastrophic flooding,"" the camp said in a statement on Monday.

""Our hearts are broken alongside our families that are enduring this unimaginable tragedy.""

US President Donald Trump said he may visit Texas later this week, but brushed off concerns his cuts to weather forecasting and related federal agencies had weakened warning systems.

Instead, he described the floods in the early hours of Friday as a ""100-year catastrophe"" that ""nobody expected.""

At least 40 adults and 28 children were killed in the worst-hit Kerr County in central Texas, Sheriff Larry Leitha said on Sunday, while at least 13 more people were killed by flooding in nearby areas.

The death toll is expected to rise.

Trump, who previously said disaster relief should be handled at the state level, signed a major disaster declaration, activating fresh funds and freeing up resources.

About 20 helicopters were taking part in the search for missing people in an area popular with campers that also hosted several summer camps for children.

Camp Mystic, one of the worst-hit, was an all-girl Christian camp where about 750 people had been staying with the floodwaters struck.

In a terrifying display of nature's power, the rain-swollen waters of the Guadalupe River reached treetops and the roofs of cabins as girls at the camp slept.

Blankets, teddy bears and other belongings were caked in mud. Windows in the cabins were shattered, apparently by the force of the water.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott warned that more heavy rainfall could bring further flooding in Kerrville and surrounding areas, as officials cautioned people against going near still-raging rivers.

Months' worth of rain fell in a matter of hours on Thursday night into Friday, and rain has continued in bouts since then.

The Guadalupe surged around 26 feet — more than a two-storey building — in just 45 minutes.

Search teams waded through mud-laden riverbanks and flew over the flood-stricken landscape on the fourth day of the search for survivors after Friday's flash floods.

Flash floods, which occur when the ground is unable to absorb torrential rainfall, are not unusual in this region of south and central Texas, known colloquially as ""Flash Flood Alley.""

Human-driven climate crisis has made extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and heat waves more frequent and more intense in recent years.

""There's debris all over the place that makes roads impassable, that makes reconstruction projects unachievable,"" Abbott said.

People from elsewhere in the state converged on Kerr County to help look for the missing.

Some residents also flew personal drones to help look, but officials urged them to stop, citing a danger to rescue aircraft."
4/23/2021 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/7244e14f9246,Why is top EU official Ursula von der Leyen facing a no-confidence vote?The European Commission President has been accused of using unofficial channels to secure a vaccine deal with Pfizer and utilising her executive power to manipulate national elections like Romania’s.,"EU’s top executive official Ursula von der Leyen, a German politician, will face a potential no-confidence vote in the European Parliament, a rare measure taken only three times in the history of the bloc.

Gheorghe Piperea, a right-wing Romanian member of the European Parliament, sought a no-confidence vote against von der Leyen on the grounds that she compromised the union’s transparency principles based on the rule of law by reaching a vaccine deal with Pfizer, a German company, through unofficial channels.

""An amendment which has a value of something like €35 billion, of course, it's completely unusual to negotiate an amendment to such a big contract by a series of SMSs,"" the Romanian politician told Türkiye’s Anadolu Agency in a recent interview.

Piperea is an ally of George Simion, the leader of the Eurosceptic party Alliance of Union of Romanians (AUR), who recently lost the presidential election against a pro-EU candidate in a close contest. Simion and his allies like Calin Georgescu, whose first run victory was cancelled by Romania’s high court, accused the EU leadership of election meddling.

But Ecaterina Matoi, an independent Bucharest-based security and political consultant, does not agree that the proposed no-confidence vote should only be seen as a retaliatory move by Piperea and his AUR party, whose Eurosceptic views motivated him to go after her.

Matoi sees some “relevance and accuracy of the accusations brought against von der Leyen and some other people connected to her”, ranging from the vaccine controversy called Pfizergate to her centralisation policies like “misusing” of Article 122 of the Treaty on Functioning of the European Union to pushing a Rearm Europe defence initiative, which is seen as overstepping EU authority.

The approval of the European Council, the collective body of the EU heads of states, is mandatory for the no-confidence motion – backed by more than 70 MEPs – to reach the floor of the European Parliament.

According to Piperea, it is very unlikely that the European Council will allow the vote and prefer “not to be forced to give an explanation about those SMSs”, exchanged between von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla.

Gheorghe Piperea, a right-wing Romanian member of the European Parliament, sought a no-confidence vote against European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

“I am almost 100% sure about this,"" Piperea adds.

While Piperea’s motion might have Eurosceptic political motivations against von der Leyen and her Commission’s centralisation policies at the expense of member-states’ sovereignty, it also has a legal ground in regard to her vaccine dealings with Pfizer.

In 2022, New York Times journalist Matina Stevis-Gridneff demanded that the Commission release the text messages between von der Leyen and the Pfizer CEO on Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. While the Commission rejected the journalist’s request, the EU's top court ruled against this decision in May, urging the release of her 2021 text messages.

But the Commission did not find any Covid-related communication because text messages are “short-lived”, according to its official statement.

The court, like many experts, found this response illogical and demanded “credible explanations” to help understand why those documents could not be found.

Emmanuel Dupuy, a French political scientist at the Catholic University of Lille, says that von der Leyen acts under the assumption that “no one is above her” and because of that, she takes “bold decisions”, such as her vaccine negotiation with Pfizer.

“There was no fair concurrency among the companies which were creating the vaccine,” Dupuy tells TRT World, referring to the EU’s controversial vaccine policies during the pandemic.

Some argue that the EU’s top official “has some interests” to make those vaccine decisions, adds Dupuy, also the president of the Institute for European Perspective and Security Studies (IPSE), a think-tank focused on track-two diplomacy and strategic analysis.

The no-confidence vote against European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen “highlights growing frustration over her leadership style"" and centralisation policies, according to experts.

Brewing anger on centralisation

But all this anger against von der Leyen is not just about vaccines.

Piperea, a well-known law professor, also accuses von der Leyen of interfering in Romanian and German elections via the EU’s Digital Services Act, according to Matoi.

This motion matters not only to Romanians but also to other EU citizens, who have difficulty digesting various EU decisions, aiming for more centralisation across the 27-member states, which violate their sovereignty, she says.

As a result, she finds Piperea’s no-confidence vote “very important” for the debate on the EU’s future.

Von der Leyen’s Commission is “increasingly centralising the EU’s decision-making process, bypassing the European Parliament’s control,” says Muzaffer Senel, a visiting scholar of the Department of Politics at Binghamton University.

Among other centralisation policies, the Commission is deciding on “budget expenditures without the approval of the EU Parliament,” which angers not only right-wing members like Piperea but also its President Roberta Metsola and his centrist allies, according to Senel.

“For example, the EU Commission recently used emergency clauses to implement the €150 billion defence credit plan known as SAFE without parliamentary approval,” Senel tells TRT World. While Metsola criticises von der Leyen’s conduct, she says that the measure is “justified” because the EU faced “an existential challenge”, a vague reference to Russia.

“It gives the impression that she is systematically and deliberately bypassing the EU Parliament. This kind of un-consultative leadership style is described by most MEPs as authoritarianism,” says Senel.

This poses a problem in terms of democratic accountability, bringing out once again the EU's old democratic deficit issue.

Democratic deficit refers to an academic criticism, which says that EU institutions' decision-making procedures do not have adequate democratic legitimacy, being less influenced by ordinary citizens than officials like von der Leyen.

She is acting with an ideological motivation to impose a supranational wisdom of Europe over member-states, says Duyup.

“Critics accuse her of bypassing democratic procedures by pushing through major deregulatory measures, such as simplifying climate and agricultural laws, without proper consultation with the Parliament or civil society,” says Abdulaziz Ahmet Yasar, a Hamburg-based expert on the EU.

The no-confidence vote “highlights growing frustration over her leadership style and the EU Commission’s accountability,” Yasar tells TRT World.

Has a no-confidence vote ever happened?

There are very few instances of no-confidence motions in the European Parliament.

“It’s extremely rare and no president has ever been removed this way. The most notable case was in 1999, when the entire European Commission led by the Luxembourgish politician Jacques Santer resigned collectively before a no-confidence vote could take place, following a corruption and mismanagement scandal,” Yasar says.

In 2005, there was a motion against the Jose Manuel Barroso Commission and in 2014 another no-confidence vote was brought to parliament floors against the Jean-Claude Juncker Commission, but both motions were rejected, says Senel.

The required threshold of the acceptance of a no-confidence vote is very high. A two-thirds majority of votes should be cast, and an absolute majority of all MEPs need to approve it."

The Kremlin said on Monday that the BRICS group of nations had never been working to undermine other countries after Trump’s threat.

Trump made the comments as BRICS leaders kicked off a summit in Brazil on Sunday.

“There will be no exceptions to this policy,"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.

Asked about Trump's remarks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin had taken note of them.

""We have indeed seen such statements by President Trump, but it is very important to note here that the uniqueness of a group like BRICS is that it is a group of countries that share common approaches and a common worldview on how to cooperate based on their own interests,"" said Peskov.

""And this cooperation within BRICS has never been and will never be directed against any third countries.""

China slams Trump’s threat

Meanwhile, China on Monday also pushed back on threats of “additional” US tariffs on nations “aligning” with the BRICS, saying there “are no winners” in trade wars.

“We believe BRICS is a force for good in the international community and does not target any third party,” China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told a live-streamed news conference in Beijing.

Mao said China “always opposed tariff war and trade war. We oppose the use of tariffs as a tool to coerce and pressure others. Imposition of tariffs serves no one's interest.”

“The BRICS is an important platform for cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries. It advocates inclusiveness and win-win cooperation,” Mao added.

BRICS was formed in 2009 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa joining in 2010. Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Iran later joined, expanding the group to 11 members, alongside 10 strategic partner countries.

The alliance aims to create alternative financial mechanisms, reduce dollar dependency, and increase Global South representation in international institutions, challenging Western-led governance structures."

According to the report, Zelenskyy has asked Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry to begin consultations with US officials regarding a potential successor.

Among the leading candidates to replace Markarova are high-profile Ukrainian officials, including Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna, Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, and Energy Minister German Galushchenko.

Markarova, a former finance minister, has served as Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States since February 2021.

President Zelenskyy shared a statement on social media platform X, describing the call with Trump as a “very important and fruitful” conversation and “probably the best” between the two leaders to date.

According to Ukraine’s State Emergency Services on Monday, two of the fatalities occurred in the eastern region of Sumy, while another person has killed in the southern Odesa region. A fourth victim, a man, has reported dead in the southern Kherson region, local governor sources has confirmed.

The attacks left more than 30 people wounded, with the majority of injuries reported in the eastern Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions.

In the capital city of Kiev, Russian drones struck several buildings, although no fatalities were recorded, Kiev’s mayor announced on Telegram.

Russia’s claims of drone interceptions

Russia's defence ministry has stated it had intercepted and destroyed 91 Ukrainian drones overnight. Eight of these drones were shot down in the Moscow region, while the majority were intercepted in areas bordering Ukraine.

The latest wave of attacks comes just days after Russia launched its largest drone and missile offensive on Ukraine since the invasion began in February 2022. On Friday, Russian forces sent 530 drones and about a dozen missiles targeting Kiev, an assault that killed at least two people.

7/7/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/354313a058ec,Trump's crackdown on pro-Palestine activists goes for federal trialThe trial in Boston is set to test allegations that the Trump administration used immigration powers to silence pro-Palestinian voices on US campuses.,"A federal bench trial began in Boston on Monday over a lawsuit challenging Trump’s immigration crackdown that targeted international students and faculty involved in pro-Palestinian protests and political activity.

Filed by several university associations against US President Donald Trump and members of his administration, the lawsuit accuses the government of orchestrating a campaign of arrests and deportations in retaliation for constitutionally protected speech.

The plaintiffs are seeking a ruling from US District Judge William Young that the policy violates both the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act, a federal law governing how agencies craft and implement regulations.

“Noncitizen students and faculty across the United States have been terrified into silence,” the plaintiffs wrote in a pretrial brief. “They’re avoiding protests, scrubbing social media, and self-censoring in classrooms and publications.”

Activism suppressed, voices silenced

The plaintiffs argue that the policy, though never formally codified, was carried out through a series of administrative actions, guidance memos, and public statements aimed at suppressing political dissent, particularly criticism of Israel.

Scholars expected to testify will describe how fear of surveillance and detention drove them to abandon advocacy for Palestinian human rights or scholarship seen as politically sensitive.

Among them is Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate, who spent 104 days in federal immigration detention before being released last month.

His case, cited in the lawsuit, became emblematic of the alleged crackdown after Trump called Khalil’s arrest “the first of many to come.”

Another plaintiff, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Türkiye, was held in a Louisiana immigration facility for six weeks after being detained on a Boston sidewalk.

Her arrest followed the publication of an op-ed critical of her university’s stance on Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza.

The plaintiffs allege the Trump administration provided universities with names of students and faculty to monitor, launched a covert social media surveillance program, and issued internal guidance to revoke visas and green cards of those tied to campus protests.

‘There is no policy’

The Trump administration, defending the case, argues no such policy ever existed and accuses the plaintiffs of misrepresenting immigration enforcement as political retribution.

“They do not allege this programme exists in any statute, regulation, or official directive,” the Justice Department wrote in court filings. “That’s because no such policy exists.”

Government lawyers further contend that immigration law gives broad discretion to authorities and that deportations based on visa violations or other legal grounds are lawful, even if the individuals involved engage in political speech.

“The plaintiffs’ case rests on a misunderstanding of the First Amendment,” the government argues, adding that its protections apply differently in immigration matters.

A landmark free speech case?

Legal analysts say the trial could set a critical precedent on the limits of immigration enforcement in the context of political speech, especially as US campuses become flashpoints in debates over Middle East policy and student activism.

Plaintiffs maintain that, regardless of formal documentation, the weight of evidence, including public statements by Trump and his officials, will show a clear pattern of targeting pro-Palestinian voices.

“Defendants have described this policy, defended it, and taken credit for it,” the plaintiffs argued. “It is only now, under legal scrutiny, that they deny it exists.”

The trial is expected to run for several days, with a ruling to follow later this year."

The special counsel team investigating Yoon's martial law declaration in December has filed a request to the Seoul Central District Court to detain Yoon on allegations of abuse of power and obstruction of justice.

Yoon has been accused of mobilising presidential guards to stop authorities from arresting him in January. He eventually was taken into custody but released from jail after 52 days on technical grounds.

The special prosecution that kicked off its investigation after new leader Lee Jae-myung was elected in June has been looking into additional charges against Yoon, who is already on trial for insurrection related to his short-lived martial law.

The detention warrant request was made on the grounds of the risk of him being a flight risk and concerns that he might interfere with witnesses linked to his case, local media reported, citing a special prosecutors' request.

""I think it's ridiculous to start a third party,"" Trump told reporters before he boarded Air Force One on his way back to Washington on Sunday.

""It's always been a two-party system, and I think starting a third party just adds to confusion.""

""Third parties have never worked. So he can have fun with it, but I think it's ridiculous,"" he said.

The world's richest person - and Trump's biggest political donor in the 2024 election - had a bitter falling out with the president after leading the Republicans’ effort to slash spending and cut federal jobs as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Musk has clashed with Trump over the president's massive domestic spending plan, saying it would explode the US debt, and vowed to do everything in his power to defeat lawmakers who voted for it.

On Saturday, he created the so-called ""America Party,"" through which the Tesla, SpaceX and X owner will attempt to do that.

In a later post on Truth Social, Trump said Musk had gone ""off the rails"" and had become ""a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks.""

He said the creation of a third party would create ""Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS.""

Trump repeated his earlier assertion that Musk, who owns the electric vehicle company Tesla, had turned on him due to his spending bill cutting electric vehicle subsidies.

Musk has argued his opposition is primarily due to the bill increasing the US fiscal deficit and sovereign debt.

Earlier on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also threw shade at Musk's attempts to enter the political fray, telling him to stick to running his companies.

When asked by CNN if Musk's plan bothered the Trump administration, Bessent offered thinly veiled criticism.

""I believe that the boards of directors at his various companies wanted him to come back and run those companies, which he is better at than anyone,"" Bessent said.

""So I imagine that those board of directors did not like this announcement yesterday and will be encouraging him to focus on his business activities, not his political activities.""

Musk left DOGE in May to focus full-time on his corporate responsibilities, with Tesla's sales and image especially suffering from his brief venture into Trump's inner circle."

Conceived two decades ago as a forum for fast-growing economies, the BRICS have come to be seen as a Chinese-driven counterbalance to Western power.

The BRICS gathering includes Iran, alongside countries like Russia and China, which maintain close ties with Tehran.

While the group’s expansion to include members such as Iran and Indonesia has made full consensus on issues like Gaza and institutional reform more complex, the 11-member bloc has nonetheless found common ground on several key fronts, as evident from statements made over the weekend.

Call for ‘unconditional ceasefire’ in GazaIn one summit declaration, the 11-member bloc urged negotiators to swiftly end Israel’s 22-month-long war in Gaza.

""We exhort the parties to engage in good faith in further negotiations to achieve an immediate, permanent and unconditional ceasefire,"" the 11-nation bloc said in a final summit statement.The BRICS countries also called for a “full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and all other parts of the occupied Palestinian Territories.”

The bloc's statement came as Gaza truce talks between Israel and Hamas resumed in Doha, and as pressure mounted to end the genocidal war which has killed at least 57,418 Palestinians in Gaza as it enters its 21th month.

Rebuke for strikes on Iran, Syria

In a separate statement, Iran secured the backing of fellow BRICS nations, with the bloc condemning recent Israel and US air strikes that hit military, nuclear and other targets.

""We condemn the military strikes against the Islamic Republic of Iran since 13 June 2025, which constitute a violation of international law,"" leaders said in a summit statement, without naming the United States or Israel by name.

""We further express serious concern over deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure and peaceful nuclear facilities,"" the statement read.

The bloc also condemned terrorist violence in Syria and Israeli occupation of Syrian land, welcome lifting of unilateral sanctions on Damascus.

Trade tensions unite members

Another summit document focused on global trade, where BRICS leaders voiced “serious concerns” over the US president’s escalating tariff threats.

Referring to Trump's recent actions, they criticised the “rise of unilateral tariff and non-tariff measures which distort trade and are inconsistent with WTO rules,” warning that such policies risk disrupting global supply chains and amplifying economic uncertainty.

BRICS described such tariffs as illegal and arbitrary, threatening to ""further reduce global trade, disrupt global supply chains, and introduce uncertainty into international economic and trade activities.""

The BRICS group which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and newer members such as Iran represents nearly half the world’s population and 40 percent of global economic output.

In a televised address, Qassem rejected any calls for Hezbollah to disarm.

Lebanese authorities have reiterated in recent months the need to place all weapons under state control.

​​​​​​​In April, President Joseph Aoun said disarming Hezbollah would require dialogue and the right political conditions.

Qassem insisted that Israel must fulfil the first phase of the ceasefire agreement by ending air violations, halting hostilities, withdrawing fully from Lebanese territory, returning prisoners, and allowing reconstruction to begin.

Only then, he said, could steps toward implementing UN Security Council Resolution 1701 move forward.

UN Security Council Resolution 1701, adopted in 2006, calls for a permanent ceasefire and the establishment of a demilitarised buffer zone along the border.

International pressure, especially from the US, has increased on Lebanon to dismantle Hezbollah’s military wing. But on Saturday, the Lebanese president told visiting UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy that Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory “complicates the state’s ability to fully assert sovereignty and enforce exclusive control over weapons.”

Israel launched a wide-scale assault on Lebanon on Oct. 8, 2023, that escalated into a full-scale war by Sept. 23, 2024. The conflict has killed more than 4,000 people, wounded over 17,000, and displaced nearly 1.4 million, according to official data.

Israeli forces have conducted near-daily attacks in southern Lebanon, claiming to target Hezbollah’s activities despite the November ceasefire deal between Israel and Lebanon. The truce ended months of cross-border warfare between Israel and the Lebanese group.

Lebanese authorities have reported nearly 3,000 Israeli violations of the truce, including the deaths of at least 225 people and injuries to more than 500, since the agreement was signed.

Under the ceasefire deal, Israel was supposed to fully withdraw from southern Lebanon by Jan. 26, but the deadline was extended to Feb. 18 after Tel Aviv refused to comply. Israel still maintains a military presence at five border outposts."

Beijing said that any single purchase order exceeding 45 million yuan ($6.3 million) in value, will not be cleared after Brussels' imposed similar curbs last month.

Tensions between Beijing and Brussels have been rising, with the European Union imposing tariffs on China-built electric vehicles and Beijing slapping duties on imported brandy from the bloc.

The European Union said last month it was barring Chinese companies from participating in EU public tenders for medical devices worth 60 billion euros ($70 billion) or more per year after concluding that EU firms were not given fair access in China.

The measure announced by the European Commission was the first under the EU's International Procurement Instrument, which entered into force in 2022 and is designed to ensure reciprocal market access.

China's countermeasures were expected after its commerce ministry flagged ""necessary steps"" against the EU move late last month.

""Regrettably, despite China's goodwill and sincerity, the EU has insisted on going its way, taking restrictive measures and building new protectionist barriers,"" the commerce ministry said in a separate statement on Sunday.

""Therefore, China has no choice but to adopt reciprocal restrictive measures.""

The EU delegation office in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

China will also restrict imports of medical devices from other countries that contain EU-made components worth more than 50% of the contract value, the finance ministry said. The measures come into force on Sunday.

The commerce ministry said products from European companies in China were not affected.

The world's second- and third-largest economies are due to hold a leaders' summit in China later in July.

On Friday, China also announced duties of up to 34.9% for five years on brandy originating in the European Union, most of it cognac from France, after concluding an investigation largely believed to be a response to Europe's EV tariffs.

Major cognac producers Pernod Ricard, LVMH and Remy Cointreau were spared from the levies, however, provided they sell at a minimum price, which China has not disclosed."

Analysts and diplomats said the lack of cohesion in an enlarged BRICS, which doubled in size last year, may affect its ability to become another pole in world affairs. They also see the summit's moderate agenda as an attempt by member countries to stay off Trump’s radar.

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva will have some of his priorities, such as debates on artificial intelligence and climate change, front and centre for the talks with key leaders not in attendance.

China's President Xi Jinping won't attend a BRICS summit for the first time since he became his country's leader in 2012. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who will make an appearance via videoconference, continues to mostly avoid travelling abroad due to an international arrest warrant.

The restraint expected in Rio de Janeiro marks a departure from last year’s summit hosted by Russia in Kazan, when the Kremlin sought to develop alternatives to US-dominated payment systems, which would allow it to dodge Western sanctions imposed after Russia's full-scale offensive on Ukraine in February 2022.

A source involved in the negotiations told journalists Friday that some members of the group want more aggressive language on the situation in Gaza and Israel's attack on Iran. The source spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak about the matter publicly.

“Brazil wants to keep the summit as technical as possible,” said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation think tank and university.

Consequently, observers expect a vague final declaration regarding Russia's war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East.

As well as suiting Brazil, a watered-down and non-controversial statement may be made easier by the absence of Putin and Xi, Stuenkel said. Those two countries have pushed for a stronger anti-Western stance, as opposed to Brazil and India, which prefer non-alignment.

A Brazilian government official told The Associated Press Thursday that the group is expected to produce three joint statements and a final declaration, “all of which are less bound by current geopolitical tensions.” The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly about the summit’s preparations.

João Alfredo Nyegray, an international business and geopolitics professor at the Pontifical Catholic University in Parana, said the summit could have played a role in showing an alternative to an unstable world, but it won’t do so.

“The withdrawal of Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the uncertainty about the level of representation for countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are confirming the difficulty for the BRICS to establish themselves as a cohesive pole of global leadership,” Nyegray said. “This moment demands high-level articulation, but we are seeing dispersion.”

Brazil, the country that chairs the bloc, has picked six strategic priorities for the summit: global cooperation in healthcare; trade, investment and finance; climate change; governance for artificial intelligence; peace-making and security; and institutional development.

It has decided to focus on less controversial issues, such as promoting trade relations between members and global health, after Trump returned to the White House, said Ana Garcia, a professor at the Rio de Janeiro Federal Rural University.

“Brazil wants the least amount of damage possible and to avoid drawing the attention of the Trump administration to prevent any type of risk to the Brazilian economy,” Garcia said.

While Brazil will continue to advocate for the reform of Western-led global institutions, a cornerstone policy of the group, the country wants to avoid becoming the target of tariffs, a predicament it has so far largely escaped.

Trump has threatened to impose 100% tariffs against the bloc if they take any moves to undermine the dollar.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Egypt’s Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi will also be absent. Those two countries joined the BRICS in 2024, alongside Ethiopia, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has been invited and is participating in member discussions, but it has yet to send its confirmation letter.

As well as new members, the bloc has 10 strategic partner countries, a category created at last year’s summit that includes Belarus, Cuba and Vietnam.

That rapid expansion led Brazil to put housekeeping issues, officially termed institutional development, on the agenda to better integrate new members and boost internal cohesion.

Despite notable absences, the summit is important for attendees, especially in the context of instability provoked by Trump’s tariff wars, said Bruce Scheidl, a researcher at the University of Sao Paulo’s BRICS study group.

“The summit offers the best opportunity for emerging countries to respond, in the sense of seeking alternatives and diversifying their economic partnerships,” Scheidl said.

For Lula, the summit will be a welcome pause from a difficult domestic scenario, marked by a drop in popularity and conflict with Congress.

The meeting also represents an opportunity to advance climate negotiations and commitments on protecting the environment before November's COP 30 climate talks in the Amazonian city of Belem."

Musk, the world's richest person and Trump's biggest political donor in the 2024 election, had a bitter falling out with the president after leading the Republicans’ effort to slash spending and cut federal jobs as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.

""When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,"" the SpaceX and Tesla boss posted on X, the social media platform that he owns.

""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom."" Musk cited a poll posted on X on Friday, US Independence Day, in which he asked whether respondents ""want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system"" that has dominated US politics for some two centuries.

The yes-or-no survey earned more than 1.2 million responses.

""By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!"" he posted on Saturday.

Trump threatened to deport Musk

The Trump-Musk feud reignited in dramatic fashion late last month as Trump pushed Republicans in Congress to ram through his massive domestic agenda in the form of the One Big Beautiful Bill.

Musk expressed fierce opposition to the legislation and ruthlessly attacked its Republican backers for supporting ""debt slavery.""

He quickly vowed to launch a new political party to challenge lawmakers who campaigned on reduced federal spending only to vote for the bill, which experts say will pile an extra $3.4 trillion over a decade onto the US deficit.

After Musk heavily criticised the flagship spending bill, which eventually passed Congress and was signed into law, Trump threatened to deport the tech tycoon and strip federal funds from his businesses.

""We'll have to take a look,"" the president told reporters when asked if he would consider deporting Musk, who was born in South Africa and has held US citizenship since 2002."

Ankara's greatest wish is that unfortunate incidents do not cause “irreparable damage” to relations between Moscow and Baku, Erdogan told reporters aboard his returning flight from Azerbaijan.

Touching on the peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Erdogan said: “We will witness an opening of new and historic windows of opportunity with the peace deal.”

Touching upon the Zangezur Corridor, a strategic route set to connect western Azerbaijan to the exclave of Nakhchivan and emerge as a key link from China to Türkiye and Russia, President Erdogan said it offers opportunities not only for Azerbaijan but for the entire region.

He noted that Ankara views the route as part of a “geo-economic revolution.”

Even though Armenia initially opposed the Zangezur Corridor, Yerevan is now showing a more flexible approach to joining economic integration, he added.

On the F-35 delivery issue between Washington and Ankara, President Erdogan said that he expects gradual delivery of F-35s to Türkiye during Trump's term, hoping that the US president will “honour our agreement.”​​​​​​​ The F-35 issue is not just about the military technology for Türkiye, said President Erdogan, adding: “It’s also about strong partnerships on global platforms, especially NATO.""

The lasting calm in the region failed due to Israel's ceasefire violations, said President Erdogan, adding that Ankara is working to prevent recurrence this time.

Türkiye believes the ceasefire between Iran and Israel has also opened the door for a Gaza truce, the president said, adding that Hamas has repeatedly shown its goodwill on this matter.

On Syria, Erdogan said that Türkiye has made its red lines clear on Syria, adding the country won’t tolerate any plan legitimising terrorist groups or their affiliates.

“We can implement models such as free trade zones, logistics hubs, and border markets in northern Syria,” Erdogan added.

1776-07-04 00:00:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/1e96627986b6,"US Independence Day: What to know about July 4th origins and traditionsFourth of July holiday, also known as Independence Day, celebrates Second Continental Congress' unanimous adoption of Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.","The Fourth of July is Americana at its core: parades and cookouts and cold beer and, of course, fireworks.

Those pyrotechnics also make it an especially dangerous holiday, typically resulting in more than 10,000 trips to the emergency room. Yet fireworks remain at the centre of Independence Day, a holiday 247 years in the making.

Here are five things to know about July Fourth, including the origin of the holiday and how fireworks became part of the tradition.

What’s the origin of Independence Day?

The holiday celebrates the Second Continental Congress’ unanimous adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, a document announcing the colonies’ separation from Great Britain.

One year later, according to the Library of Congress, a spontaneous celebration in Philadelphia marked the anniversary of American independence.

But across the burgeoning nation, observations didn’t become commonplace until after the War of 1812. It quickly took off: The Library of Congress notes that major historic events in the 19th century, such as groundbreaking ceremonies for the Erie Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, were scheduled to coincide with Fourth of July festivities.

How did fireworks became a July fourth tradition?

The display of pyrotechnics has been a big part of Independence Day from the outset. Founding Father John Adams saw it coming.

Commemoration of America’s independence ""ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more,"" Adams wrote in a letter to his wife, Abigail, dated July 3, 1776.

Fireworks were around centuries before America became a nation.

The American Pyrotechnics Association says many historians believe fireworks were first developed in the second century BC in ancient China by throwing bamboo stalks into fires, causing explosions as the hollow air pockets overheated.

By the 15th century, fireworks were widely used for religious festivals and public entertainment in Europe and early US settlers carried on those traditions, the association said.

Has a president ever refused to celebrate?

Presidents from George Washington to Donald Trump have celebrated the nation’s birth on the Fourth of July, with one exception: Adams.

His letter to his wife aside, Adams refused to celebrate the holiday on July 4 because he felt July 2 was the real Independence Day. Why? It was on July 2, 1776, that the Continental Congress voted in favor of the resolution for independence, though the Declaration of Independence wasn’t formally adopted until two days later.

Adams was so adamant that he turned down invitations to festivals and other events, even while serving as the nation’s second president. Ironically, Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, both died on the 50th anniversary of the document’s formal adoption, July 4, 1826.

How popular are fireworks?

Consumer sales of fireworks have grown rapidly over the past two decades.

Statistics from the American Pyrotechnics Association show that in 2000, American consumers spent $407 million on fireworks. By 2024, that figure rose to $2.2 billion. The biggest jump came during the Covid-19 pandemic, when public fireworks displays were shut down. Consumer sales jumped from $1 billion in 2019 to $1.9 billion in 2020.

The cost of fireworks could soar if the trade war between the US and China continues — most aerial shells, paper rockets and sparkly fountains that transfix the eyes of Americans every Fourth of July are imported from China.

A 90-day pause on Trump's hefty tariffs on Chinese imports brought some temporary relief, but industry experts are uncertain as they watch for an agreement.

Despite widespread education efforts, thousands of Americans are badly injured by fireworks each year.

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that in 2024, 11 deaths were blamed on fireworks, up 38 percent from 2023. An estimated 1,700 people were treated at emergency rooms for sparkler-related injuries and 14,7000 people were injured from fireworks — a 52 percent increase compared to 2023.

Burns were the most common injury. People hurt their hands and fingers most often, and head, face and ear injuries were frequent, too.

For those planning to shoot off fireworks, experts urge finding a flat, hard, level surface away from structures and other things that could catch fire. The person responsible for the fireworks should avoid alcohol. Children should never ignite them.

Experts have also encouraged having a bucket or hose nearby in case of fire or explosion. Shoot off one at a time and walk away quickly after igniting, she said, and never relight or handle a malfunctioned firework. When done, shovel up the remains and soak them before disposing."

The move follows years of steadily warming ties between Moscow and Kabul, including energy cooperation deals signed in 2022, the removal of the Taliban from Russia’s list of terrorist organisations on April 17 this year and the recent exchange of ambassadors.

The announcement of recognition was made during a meeting in Kabul between Afghanistan’s acting foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, and Russia’s ambassador to Afghanistan, Dmitry Zhirnov.

Taliban government’s foreign ministry spokesperson Hafiz Zia Ahmad Takal confirmed the news in a video statement, emphasising, “Russia is the first country which has officially recognised the Islamic Emirate,” referring to the Taliban’s preferred name for their administration, which is still widely shunned by the international community.

In a separate statement, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it believed the official recognition would “give an impetus to the development of productive bilateral cooperation” and pledged continued support for Kabul in “strengthening regional security and fighting terrorist threats and drug crime’’.

From enemy to ally: Why Russia made the first move

Russia’s recognition is not just a strategic shift, but also a striking reversal of history. It is now legitimising a government formed by the same Taliban forces whose ideological predecessors helped drive out Soviet troops from Afghanistan in the 1980s.

The Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan in December 1979 to support the erstwhile communist government in the country, its client state at the time, and remained in the country till being driven out in 1989.

While the fight against Soviet troops in Afghanistan remains a painful chapter in Russian history, claiming the lives of around 15,000 Soviet soldiers and contributing to the collapse of the USSR in 1991, it has also become a lens through which many Russians interpret the US failure in the region.

For some, the swift collapse of the American-backed Afghan government in 2021 served as a vindication of Moscow’s past strategy and reinforced Russia’s belief in its deeper understanding of Afghan dynamics.

The Kremlin’s decision is rooted in three key geopolitical objectives. First of all, Russia is seeking to fill the strategic vacuum left by the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.

According to the political scientist Charles E. Ziegler, the abrupt end of America’s two-decade presence, which started following the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center in New York City, created an opening for regional actors like Russia to expand their influence and reposition themselves as dominant players in Central Asia.

The absence of a reliable successor to uphold Washington’s regional vision has, observers argue, opened the door for Moscow to deepen its presence in Central Asia and present itself as a regional security guarantor.

Russia has historically regarded Central Asia as part of its sphere of influence. Its recent steps, such as forming bilateral partnerships and engaging in multilateral frameworks like the Collective Security Treaty Organisation and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, reflect a broader push to reassert dominance against Western involvement.

The recognition complements similar moves by Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, which have recently deepened trade and energy ties with the Taliban government.

The second issue is that the Russian officials increasingly view the Taliban as a stabilising force in Afghanistan, particularly in curbing the influence of the regional affiliates of the terrorist organisation Daesh.

This perspective has gained traction as security concerns grow over the group’s operations across Afghanistan and Central Asia.

Tensions escalated in March 2024 when the Daesh branch carried out a devastating attack at Moscow’s Crocus City Hall, killing over 130 people.

The incident marked one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Russia in decades and prompted Moscow to deepen security coordination with the Taliban, who are also actively engaged in fighting Daesh within Afghan territory.

According to the London-based TV station Afghanistan International, Russia regards the Taliban as pragmatic actors — cooperative on border security and unlikely to spread regional instability.

From Moscow’s perspective, formal recognition of the Taliban is not about political endorsement, but securing leverage in a shifting geopolitical landscape.

A third factor shaping Russia’s decision to recognise the Taliban government is the evolving landscape of Afghanistan’s drug economy.

Under Taliban administration, Afghanistan has seen a dramatic decline in opium production following a strict poppy cultivation ban announced in April 2022.

According to UN data, poppy cultivation dropped by over 95 percent from 2022 to 2023, a shift that aligns with the Taliban’s efforts to portray itself as a responsible actor capable of addressing long-standing international concerns.

Moscow, long burdened by drug trafficking from Afghanistan via Central Asia, views the Taliban government’s enforcement of the ban as a potential security gain.

However, this apparent progress masks deeper structural challenges. While opium output has plummeted, the vacuum has accelerated a pivot towards synthetic drug production, particularly methamphetamine, creating new public health and trafficking risks across the region.

With vast stockpiles of opium still in circulation and a growing synthetic drug trade, Russia is likely seeking greater influence in Afghan counter-narcotics policy to protect its borders and curtail regional drug flows.

In this context, formal recognition offers Moscow a stronger diplomatic channel to engage the Taliban on shared drug control and security objectives.

Will China and Gulf states follow?

While Russia has formally recognised the Taliban government, other major regional actors have taken a more cautious approach.

China has ramped up its economic engagement with Afghanistan since the Taliban’s return to power in 2021, but it has stopped short of a formal diplomatic recognition.

In January 2023, Beijing signed a $540 million oil extraction agreement with the Taliban administration, marking the first major international energy deal under the new regime.

More recently, in May 2025, China, Pakistan, and the Taliban government agreed to extend the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) into Afghanistan, a move aimed at strengthening regional connectivity and fostering economic development.

These moves signal Beijing’s pragmatic engagement with the Taliban administration, driven largely by security interests and economic opportunity.

Yet, despite growing trade and infrastructure ties, China has refrained from granting formal diplomatic recognition to the group-led administration, likely due to concerns over the group’s governance practices and international legitimacy.

Gulf countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, have also deepened their contacts with the group without taking the final step towards official recognition.

The UAE has hosted high-level Taliban officials and reopened its embassy in Kabul, while Qatar continues to play a key mediating role between the Taliban rule and the international community.

Since 2013, Qatar has hosted the Taliban’s political office in Doha, which became the central venue for peace talks with the United States and other stakeholders. The 2020 Doha Agreement between the US and the Taliban government, paving the way for the eventual withdrawal of American forces, was brokered on Qatari soil.

Despite these gestures, Gulf governments remain noncommittal, balancing regional influence and humanitarian cooperation with concerns over global backlash and human rights issues.

Russia’s recognition of the Taliban administration marks a major shift in international engagement with Afghanistan’s rulers, driven by Moscow’s security and geopolitical interests.

Yet other regional powers like China and the Gulf states remain cautious, opting for pragmatic cooperation without formal recognition.

Afghanistan’s path to legitimacy under Taliban administration remains constrained by concerns over rights, governance, and internal stability."

This time, by using the word ""shylock"" to decry amoral money lenders.

On Thursday night in his speech in Iowa, Trump used the term ""shylock"" while talking about his signature legislation that was passed by Congress earlier in the day.

""No death tax, no estate tax, no going to the banks and borrowing some from, in some cases, a fine banker and in some cases shylocks and bad people,"" he said.

""They took away a lot of, a lot of family. They destroyed a lot of families, but we did the opposite.""

When a reporter later asked about the word's ""anti-Semitic"" association and his intent, Trump said; ""No, I've never heard it that way. To me, a shylock is somebody that's a money lender at high rates. I've never heard it that way. You view it differently than me. I've never heard that.""

Shylock refers to the villainous Jewish moneylender in Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice"" who demands a pound of flesh from a debtor, merchant Antonio, if he failed to repay a loan.

Trump told reporters early on Friday after returning from an event in Iowa that he had ""never heard it that way"" and ""never heard that"" the term was considered an offensive stereotype about Jews.

Pro-Israeli Zionist group, the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement that the term ""evokes a centuries-old anti-Semitic trope about Jews and greed that is extremely offensive and dangerous. President Trump's use of the term is very troubling and irresponsible.""

The Anti-Defamation League said Trump's use of the word ""underscores how lies and conspiracies about Jews remain deeply entrenched in our country. Words from our leaders matter and we expect more from the President of the United States.""

Conflating Israel criticism as anti-Semitism

The Trump administration has prioritised cracking down on anti-Semitism, although critics caution against conflating criticism of Israel's genocide in Gaza with anti-Semitism.

On US campuses, where students and scholars have led large pro-Palestine and anti-genocide protests last year, criticising Israel's policies has become impossible without being labelled as anti-Semitic.

In 2023, the University of Pennsylvania blocked a documentary screening critical of Israel.

Brandeis University, despite pledging commitment to free speech, barred a pro-Palestinian student group due to statements from its national chapter.

The University of Vermont cancelled a talk by a Palestinian poet after some students falsely claimed he was anti-Semitic.

American colleges have clamped down on pro-Palestine protests and events on campus, as the institutions face pressure from donors, alumni and politicians, furious over criticism of Israel's genocide in Gaza, which they falsely claim is an anti-Semitic campaign against Jews.

Many other campuses have also taken a hard line on pro-Palestine and anti-war groups.

Trump's administration has, meanwhile, said it is screening for alleged anti-Semitism activity when granting immigration benefits and its fight with Harvard University has centered on allegations from the White House that the school has tolerated anti-Semitism.

He told the Republican Jewish Coalition in 2015 that ""you want to control your politicians"" and suggested the audience used money to exert control.

Before he kicked off his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump drew widespread criticism for dining at his Florida club with a Holocaust-denying white nationalist.

Last year, Trump made repeated comments accusing Jewish Americans who identify as Democrats of disloyalty because of the Democratic leaders' criticisms of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Democrat Joe Biden, while vice president, said in 2014 that he had made a ""poor choice"" of words a day after he used ""shylocks"" in remarks to a legal aid group.

Biden had mentioned this in a speech, recounting his son's time in Iraq. He met soldiers needing legal aid for issues at home.

""I mean these shylocks who took advantage of, um, these women and men while overseas,"" he said at the time."

The bill underlined the president's dominance over the Republican Party, which had been wracked by misgivings over a text that will balloon the national debt and gut health and welfare support.

A small group of opponents in the party finally fell into line after Speaker Mike Johnson worked through the night to corral dissenters in the House of Representatives behind the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"".

The bill squeezed past a final vote 218-214 on Thursday, meaning it can be on Trump's desk to be signed into law on the July 4th Independence Day holiday.

""One of the most consequential Bills ever. The USA is the 'HOTTEST' Country in the World, by far!!!"" Trump said on social media as he sensed victory.

The timing of the vote slipped back as Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke against the bill for nearly nine hours to delay proceedings.

Mass deportations, tax breaks

The legislative win is the latest in a series of successes for Trump, including a Supreme Court ruling last week that curbed lone judges from blocking his policies, and US air strikes that led to a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.

His sprawling mega-bill just passed the Senate on Tuesday and had to return to the lower chamber for a rubber stamp of the senators' revisions.

The package honours many of Trump's campaign promises: boosting military spending, funding a mass migrant deportation drive and committing $4.5 trillion to extend his first-term tax relief.

""Today we are laying a key cornerstone of America's new Golden Age,"" Johnston said.

But it is expected to pile an extra $3.4 trillion over a decade onto the country's fast-growing deficits, while shrinking the federal food assistance program and forcing through the largest cuts to the Medicaid health insurance scheme for low-income Americans since its 1960s launch.

Some estimates put the total number of recipients set to lose their insurance coverage under the bill at 17 million. Scores of rural hospitals are expected to close.

While Republican moderates in the House fear the cuts will damage their prospects of reelection, fiscal hawks chafed over savings that they say fall far short of what was promised.

Johnson had to negotiate tight margins, and could only lose a handful of lawmakers in the final vote, among more than two dozen who had earlier declared themselves open to rejecting Trump's 869-page text.

Trump has spent weeks hitting the phones and hosting White House meetings to cajole lawmakers torn between angering welfare recipients at home and incurring the president's wrath.

Democrats hope public opposition to the bill will help them flip the House in the 2026 midterm election, pointing to data showing that it represents a huge redistribution of wealth from the poorest Americans to the richest.

Jeffries held the floor for his Democrats ahead of the final vote, as he told stories of everyday Americans who he argued would be harmed by Trump's legislation.

""This bill, this one big, ugly bill – this reckless Republican budget, this disgusting abomination – is not about improving the quality of life of the American people,"" he said.

Extra spending on the military and border security will be paid in part through ending clean energy and electric vehicle subsidies – a factor triggering a bitter public feud between Trump and former supporter Elon Musk."

The stemwinder began at 4:53 a.m. EDT and has touched an array of subjects, including the reading of letters from Americans who rely on government programs such as Medicaid and SNAP.

Jeffries, in his 8 hour and 44 minute speech, said the bill ""steals"" from those programmes to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy.

The speech took on the air of a Sunday church service air as it extended into its eighth hour and he began citing passages from the Bible.

""Take your time,"" ""Take your sweet time,"" colleagues replied as he spoke.

""Shame on this institution if this bill passes,"" he said.

There’s no filibuster in the House, but Jeffries essentially conducted one anyway.

Jeffries is taking his ""sweet time"" with a marathon floor speech that has given his minority party a lengthy spotlight to excoriate what he called an ""immoral"" bill.

As Democratic leader, Jeffries can speak for as long as he wants during debate on legislation — hence its nickname on Capitol Hill, the ""magic minute,"" that lasts as long as leaders are speaking.

The previous record set by then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in 2021, when he was the GOP leader.

McCarthy spoke for 8 hours, 32 minutes when he angrily criticised Democrats' ""Build Back Better"" legislation, breaking a record set by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., when she spoke about immigration for 8 hours, 7 minutes in 2018.

The speech pushed a final vote on Republican President Donald Trump's tax bill, initially expected in the early morning, into the daylight hours.

He also killed time by riffing on hip-hop, King George III and his own life story, among other diversions.

He called out Republicans who have voiced concerns about the bill, read stories from people concerned about their health care from those GOP lawmakers’ districts and praised his own members, some of whom sat behind him and cheered, clapped, laughed and joined hands.

Jeffries sneaked small bites of food and drank liquids to boost his energy, but did not leave the chamber or his podium.

The speech would be over if he did.

Democrats were powerless to stop the huge bill, which Republicans are passing by using an obscure budget procedure that bypasses the Senate filibuster.

So they were using the powers they do have, mostly to delay. In the Senate, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York forced Senate clerks to read the bill for almost 16 hours over the weekend.

Senator Cory Booker, D-N.J., similarly gained attention in April when he spoke for more than 25 hours on the Senate floor and broke the record for the longest continuous Senate floor speech in the chamber’s history.

Booker was assisted by fellow Democrats who gave him a break from speaking by asking him questions on the Senate floor, but Jeffries' ""magic minute"" did not allow for any interaction with other members.

Republicans who were sitting on the floor when Jeffries started trickled out, leaving half the chamber empty. And as they anxiously awaited their vote, some mocked him on social media."
7/3/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/922c5db4fabe,"Israel has abducted and jailed 1,000,000 Palestinians since 1967 — US group's reportTel Aviv has jailed Palestinians at an average of 47 per day, says a new study, adding US ""bankrolled this oppression"" against Palestinians for nearly 700 months.","On February 24, Israeli occupation troops abducted Fidaa Assaf from the village of Kafr Laqif in Palestine's Qalqilya governorate. She was returning from Ramallah Medical Complex after undergoing medical examinations.

Palestinian officials later revealed that the female prisoner, who is married and a mother, was subjected to multiple strip searches and verbal abuse.

They also noted that she was detained in a cell described as unhygienic and infested with insects, and was deprived of water and food for several days.

Despite battling cancer, the Israeli regime is holding Assaf in the notorious Damon Prison, where approximately 42 female prisoners, including pregnant prisoners such as Zahraa Kawazbeh and Doaa Kawazbeh, are subjected to extreme torture and deliberate medical neglect.

Abductees such as Assaf, Kawazbeh, and Kawazbeh have one thing in common — they are part of a huge army of 1,000,000 Palestinians who have been jailed and tortured by Israel since 1967, a policy, which according to a new study, serves as the ""backbone"" of Israel's occupation of Palestine.

The report, released by non-profit American Muslims for Palestine on Thursday, said that Israel's carceral system remains the ""backbone of its occupation"" of Palestine, with Tel Aviv jailing about one million Palestinians at an average of 47 per day for 58 years.

""Israel has historically kept prison head-count near 6,000 at any one time, fluctuating during escalations, but reverting to the mean quickly,"" according to the study titled ""The Carceral History of Occupied Palestine"".

As of May 2025, the study said, Israel holds in its jails 10,068 Palestinians. Of these, 1,455 are sentenced, 3,190 await trial, and 3,577 are held without charge under administrative detention.

In contrast, the Palestinian group Hamas, after capturing 251 people during its October 2023 raid on Israeli military sites and settlements that were once Arab farms and homes, has released dozens of hostages.

It currently holds 49 captives, including 27 who are feared to have been killed in indiscriminate Israeli strikes.

""Meanwhile, administrative detention has exploded after Israel's 2023 genocide in Gaza, jumping from 350 to 2,373 detainees per month — a seven-fold surge that now accounts for nearly one-third of all prisoners,"" the report said.

Tel Aviv enforces its carceral system with movement barriers and draconian laws, it said, adding, the occupied West Bank now suffers from almost 900 Israeli military's checkpoints, gates, and roadblocks, up from 645 in 2023, paralysing daily life.

In the first half of 2024, the study said that Israeli military conducted 3,384 documented search-and-arrest operations across the occupied West Bank.

""In April 2025 alone, Israeli forces conducted mass raids resulting in 530 arrests, including 60 children and 18 women, across cities, towns, and refugee camps in the West Bank,"" it said.

The report highlighted Israeli Knesset's 2024 amendments ""legalising collective punishment and permitting life sentences for children aged 12.""

The American Muslims for Palestine said in its report that all along it is United States that has ""bankrolled this oppression"", adding Washington recently gave more than $14 billion to Israel to carry out genocide against Palestinians of besieged Gaza.

""Since 1948, Congress has appropriated an inflation-adjusted $383.75 billion in aid, promising at least $3.8 billion in annual aid since 2016, while rushing to give Israel $14.1 billion in April 2025 to underwrite their genocide.""

Unlike other countries, the group said, the American money for Israel arrives as an immediate lump-sum, lets Israel earn interest, and flows through lightly-scrutinised Direct Commercial Sales that speed up US weapon approvals to their military, prison guards, and illegal settlers alike.

""Israel's carceral system, its military courts, administrative detention, torture, deportations, and child imprisonment constitute a comprehensive and deliberate apparatus of domination,"" the group said.

It said the system is sustained by US money, weapons, and diplomatic cover.

""To uphold international law and Palestinian rights, the system must be dismantled entirely, and US support must end.""

The American Muslims for Palestine said that Israel's recent legislative actions, its ongoing genocide in Gaza, its escalating repression of their own Palestinian citizens, and advancement of the occupation of the West Bank, and occupied East Jerusalem, ""indicates that Israel has no intention of altering its carceral system.""

""While this report has documented high rates of detention and imprisonment, in order to fully comprehend the scale of these systems, it is critical to recognise that while not every Palestinian has experienced detention formally, every Palestinian living under Israeli occupation has been subject to the occupation’s carceral programme in some capacity,"" the group added.

The group said Israel is using incarceration, especially of children, to exhaust, deter, and displace Palestinians.

The carceral state, the group concluded, underpins occupation, functioning as a mechanism of apartheid and the US complicity, via material support, necessitates its abolition.

Israel's genocide in Gaza

Israel has been carrying out a genocide in Gaza since October 2023.

Palestinians have recorded killings of more than 57,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children. Some 11,000 Palestinians are feared buried under rubble of annihilated homes, according to Palestine's official WAFA news agency.Experts, however, contend that the actual death toll significantly exceeds what the Gaza authorities have reported, estimating it could be around 200,000.

Since October 2023, Israel and illegal Zionist settlers have escalated its violence in the occupied West Bank, killing 1,000 Palestinians.

Washington allocates $3.8 billion in annual military funding to its long-standing ally Israel.Since October 2023, the US has spent more than $22 billion supporting Israel's genocide in Gaza and wars in neighbouring countries.Despite senior US officials criticising Israel regarding the high civilian death toll in Gaza, Washington has, thus far, resisted calls to place conditions on any arms transfers."

Jeffries was on Thursday using the rarely seen ""magic minute"" to stall the final vote on Trump's sweeping policy bill (Officially The One Big Beautiful Bill Act), and steal away his party's moment in the spotlight.The bill, a centrepiece of Trump's post-reelection agenda, funds tax cuts and national security by cutting the federal safety net. After days of resistance, House GOP holdouts backed it, clearing the way for a final vote before the president's self-imposed July 4 deadline.

Jeffries, standing at the centre of the chamber, appears in no hurry.

The New York Democrat is reading slowly from a thick binder filled with letters from Americans who, he says, would be harmed if the bill passes — the single mother with a disabled child in Ohio, the cancer survivor worried about losing coverage, the rural farmer from Missouri fearful that local hospitals will shut down.

That last one is a pointed jab: the farmer lives in the district of House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, who happens to be standing silently in the back of the room as Jeffries reads.

This isn't a filibuster, technically. But it may as well be.

The ""magic minute"" is a House rule that gives party leaders the right to speak for as long as they want, under the guise of a one-minute speech. It is rarely used, and almost never for this long.

A sense of theatreJeffries, pausing between phrases, stretching each thought, is turning time into a weapon, much to the chagrin of the White House.

The House chamber also reflects the slow tension. Democrats, seated behind Jeffries, rise every few minutes to applaud. Some wander out for coffee, then return. There's motion, but little urgency. Republicans are scattered across the other side, many slumped in their chairs, thumbing through phones or murmuring among themselves. There's a sense of theatre — and fatigue.

Speaker Mike Johnson made a quiet appearance earlier, chatting with members, but left before Jeffries had even hit his second hour. The megabill in question, a sprawling package of spending cuts, tax code revisions and regulatory overhauls, is being pushed as a fix to inflation and federal ""waste."" Democrats call it a wrecking ball. Medicaid is the biggest flashpoint: analysts say millions could be pushed off coverage. There are also deep cuts to food assistance and climate programmes, along with major tax relief for corporations.

With no power to stop the bill from passing, House Democrats are turning to time and optics.

The bill passed the US Senate on July 1, 2025, narrowly in a 51–50 vote, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote.

Jeffries' speech in the House may not alter the math. But it delays the moment. The Democrats aim to delay Trump's crowning glory.Not surprisingly, it draws the cameras. It puts faces — and stories — on numbers.

At some point, Jeffries will yield. When he does, Speaker Johnson is expected to speak briefly before the vote is called.

""We're excited to get this done. If Hakeem would stop talking, we’ll get the job done for the American people,"" Johnson told reporters on Thursday morning.

But for now, Jeffries stands, voice steady, pausing often, not to collect his thoughts, but to run out the clock.

In a chamber built for speed — with timers and gongs and hard rules — the ""magic minute"" is one of the last tools of dissent.""I will take my sweet time,"" Jeffries vowed as he uses every second of it in the US Congress."
7/3/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/38477269e8ee,US House Republicans head toward final vote on Trump's sweeping tax-cut bill as Democrats hold floorHouse Republicans are ready to vote on Trump's $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill after staying up all night with GOP leaders and president himself working to persuade sceptical holdouts to drop their resistance.,"Republicans in the US House of Representatives have advanced President Donald Trump's massive tax-cut and spending bill toward a final yes-or-no vote, appearing to overcome internal party divisions over its cost.

During a marathon overnight session, lawmakers cleared a final procedural hurdle needed to begin debate on the bill in a 219-213 vote at around 3:30 a.m. ET (0730 GMT) on Thursday.

It was not clear when they would hold a final vote on passing the legislation. If it is approved, the bill will go to Trump to sign into law.

The bill would extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, cut health and food safety net programmes, fund the president's immigration crackdown, and eliminate many green-energy incentives.

It also includes a $5 trillion increase in the nation's debt ceiling, which lawmakers must address in the coming months to avert a devastating default.

Republicans broadly support the bill, which contains most of Trump's domestic priorities, saying it would spur economic growth and deliver tax breaks to Americans across the economic spectrum.

Democrats are united in opposition to the bill but lack the votes to stop it, as Republicans control both the House and the Senate by slim margins.

Republicans can afford no more than three defections in either chamber to get a final bill passed.

Early on Thursday, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries was four hours into a speech in which he blasted the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy that would come at the expense of less affluent Americans.

""This disgusting abomination is not about improving the quality of life of the American people,"" he said. ""The focus of this bill, the justification for all of the cuts that will hurt everyday Americans is to provide massive tax breaks for billionaires.""

Several dozen Democrats joined Jeffries on the House floor, while only a handful of Republicans were in the cavernous chamber.

Jeffries' speech recalled a record-setting April speech by Democratic Senator Cory Booker that accused Trump of ""recklessly"" challenging the nation's democratic institutions.

The past two weeks have shown deep Republican divides on the bill, which would add $3.4 trillion to the nation's $36.2 trillion in debt.

That debt has grown steadily over the past two decades regardless of which party was in control in Washington.

The bill would also make major cuts to social programmes including Medicaid, ultimately leaving nearly 12 million Americans without health insurance.

Rural hospitals have warned that could force them to scale back service, prompting Republicans to add $50 billion to help keep them afloat.

A handful of Republican holdouts have objected to the bill.

One, Senator Thom Tillis, opted not to seek re-election after voting against it.

Trump manages to tame rebels

Nonetheless, Trump has succeeded in getting the votes to advance the legislation at each step of the way. The Senate passed the legislation by the narrowest possible margin on Tuesday.

Votes in the House, which Republicans control by a 220-212 margin, were held open for hours on Wednesday during the day and overnight as House Speaker Mike Johnson and the White House talked with reluctant members.

Republican leaders said Trump made late-night phone calls to win over wavering Republicans, but they predicted that some would still vote against it.

“Nothing has been unanimous in this for process, and that's going to hold true on the floor,” Representative Steve Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, told reporters.

Trump kept up the pressure. ""FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!"" he wrote on social media.

Any changes made by the House would require another Senate vote, which would make it all but impossible to meet Trump's self-imposed deadline of getting the legislation approved by the July 4 Independence Day holiday.

Scalise said that delay would not happen.

""What really got everybody to the finish line is the realization, there aren't going to be any more changes to this bill. It's time to come together, make a decision,"" he said."
7/3/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/4fa4057fe169,Why lithium-ion batteries could be the next friction point in China-US trade warChina’s expanding role in battery production through its Indonesia partnership is setting the stage for sharper competition with the US over clean energy supply chains.,"Indonesia’s announcement on Sunday of a major lithium-ion battery plant backed by Chinese giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) marks a new chapter in the global contest for clean energy dominance.

The plant, which is set to open by the end of 2026, will produce batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage systems, beginning with a capacity of 6.9 gigawatt hours and potentially expanding to 40 gigawatt hours.

The battery plant will be built in West Java, while the remaining sub-projects will be in eastern Indonesia’s nickel-rich province of North Maluku.

Indonesia holds the world’s largest nickel reserves, and nickel is a crucial raw material for lithium-ion batteries.

The Southeast Asian nation has now set an ambitious goal of producing about 600,000 electric vehicles by 2030. This would be nearly 13 times the number sold in the country last year.

These figures gain greater importance amid escalating US-China trade tensions.

President Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs, introduced in April, had initially pushed US duties on Chinese goods to 145 percent, with China retaliating by imposing a 125 percent levy on US goods.

But following the Geneva talks in May, US tariffs were reduced to 30 percent, while China lowered its duties to 10 percent.

The strategic importance of critical materials —such as nickel, lithium, and rare earth elements— needed for batteries and other advanced technologies has forced both sides towards a compromise.

Last month, the countries formalised a deal on rare earth shipments after China leveraged its 90 percent control of global processing to impose export restrictions.

The curbs caused a 37 percent drop in the sale of rare earth minerals and 58 percent drop in the sale of rare earth magnets to the US, triggering a “panic” over production shutdowns.

In 2023, China accounted for 58 percent of global processed battery mineral exports, 53 percent of battery material exports, and 74 percent of battery pack and component exports.

The United States, in comparison, has struggled to establish lithium supply chains that are independent of China and continues to rely on Chinese-controlled processing and battery components despite the government’s growing security concerns.

While the US scrambles to build domestic capacity through the Inflation Reduction Act’s $7.5 billion investment, China’s $6 billion power battery partnership with Indonesia illustrates how control over raw materials and new production sites is shaping the global battery supply chain.

As the two superpowers compete for dominance in battery manufacturing and access to critical minerals, the future of the clean energy transition may depend on which country can secure these supply chains first.

Clean energy and EVs

Lithium-ion batteries have a central role in the clean energy transformation.

These rechargeable power sources play a vital role in making renewable energy dependable and are essential for technologies that support the transition to a low-carbon future.

While lithium does not generate power, lithium-ion batteries store energy when production is high and supply it when needed, helping to balance the use of wind, solar, and other clean sources.

In electric vehicles, batteries make up about a third of the total cost and are key to how far the car can travel, how fast it charges, and how long it lasts. The shift from petrol and diesel engines to electric motors depends fully on having enough batteries that perform well at a reasonable price.

By 2030, more than 40 percent of cars sold worldwide are expected to be EVs, but battery production will be the main factor limiting how fast this change can happen.

“Control over lithium-ion battery supply chains equates to control over critical technology for the 21st century,” says global risk specialist Tony Loughran of Zero Risk International, a security and risk-management consultancy.

The impact of battery technology goes beyond the automotive sector, as it now supports the economies of major nations and creates new dependencies across a wide range of industries.

Consumer electronics, from watches to calculators, as well as medical devices, telecommunications equipment and military systems, all depend on reliable battery supply.

China’s supply chain power

China’s dominance in lithium-ion battery production stems from two decades of strategic industrial policy that has created an integrated ecosystem from raw materials to finished products.

Chinese companies currently control nearly 75 percent of the world’s lithium-ion battery cell production capacity by value, with industry giants CATL and BYD alone commanding over 50 percent market share.

This manufacturing dominance rests on even more comprehensive control over upstream supply chains. Apart from its 90 percent control over global processing of rare earth minerals, China processes 60-70 percent of lithium and cobalt.

“All these indicators suggest to me that China is pulling ahead not just by producing batteries, but by locking in upstream materials and regional production hubs in ways that the US and its allies have yet to replicate,” Loughran tells TRT World.

His assessment reflects growing concern among Western policymakers about structural disadvantages in battery supply chains.

The Indonesia partnership exemplifies China’s systematic approach to supply chain control. By investing in battery production near raw material sources, China effectively localises supply chains while securing upstream access.

This strategy contrasts sharply with Western approaches that often separate mining, processing, and manufacturing across different continents.

American efforts to build domestic battery capacity face daunting challenges. Despite the Inflation Reduction Act’s $7.5 billion allocation for battery supply chains and generous manufacturing tax credits, the US currently produces only 10-12 percent of global battery capacity.

Reaching the planned 1,000 GWh annual capacity by 2030 would require building more battery factories in six years than China constructed over two decades.

“The Indonesia-CATL battery plant is a potent example of how China is advancing its long-term strategy to dominate clean energy technologies by integrating raw material access with high-end manufacturing,” says Loughran.

He describes this as both “a wake-up call and a challenge” for the US as it confronts rising competition from China.

Escalation scenarios and strategic vulnerabilities

The concentration of battery supply chains creates multiple vectors for potential trade conflicts. China’s control over critical processing stages provides powerful economic weapons that could quickly reshape global industries.

“Additionally, if China begins to restrict exports or impose tariffs on high-grade battery components, it could dramatically impact Western EV makers and energy storage firms,” warns Loughran.

Already, Beijing is tightening control by setting a six-month limit on rare-earth export licences for US automakers and manufacturers, giving more leverage to China if trade tensions flare up again.

Major Western automakers, including Tesla, BMW, and Volkswagen, rely on Chinese battery suppliers for significant portions of their EV production.

Even companies attempting to build alternative supply chains often discover that processing equipment, technical expertise, and refined materials still trace back to Chinese sources.

A restriction on Chinese cathode materials would simultaneously impact EV production in Detroit, grid storage projects in California, and consumer electronics manufacturing across Asia.

Such battery supply restrictions wouldn’t just hit transportation, they would strike at the heart of the digital economy.

The challenge for the US now is how to secure these supply chains and remain competitive.

Loughran believes this will require a far more coordinated strategy from Washington.

“The US must accelerate investments, strengthen alliances, and secure access to critical minerals if it hopes to remain competitive in the battery and EV arms race,” he says."

The House of Representatives had yet to give final approval to the Senate-passed version of the bill, which includes sweeping tax cuts, massive increases in defence spending, and unprecedented reductions in social safety net programmes.

But the legislation, which embodies many of Trump’s core campaign promises, now faces mounting resistance from both fiscal conservatives and moderate Republicans.

By midnight, Speaker Mike Johnson was still holding open a critical procedural vote — the last step before the bill could move to final passage — more than two hours after it was first called. Behind the scenes, party leaders were locked in frantic negotiations with GOP holdouts.

“We’re going to get there tonight. We’re working on it and very, very positive about our progress,” Johnson told reporters, according to Politico.

High stakes, deep divisions

Originally passed by the House in May, the 887-page legislation returned to the lower chamber after scraping through the Senate on Tuesday by a single vote.

Changes made in the Senate moved the bill further right, causing fractures to widen in the House GOP caucus.

The package commits $4.5 trillion to extend Trump’s tax cuts, funds a large-scale immigration crackdown, and boosts defence spending, all while adding an estimated $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

To offset the cost, the bill includes what analysts describe as the most drastic cuts to Medicaid since its inception, prompting warnings that up to 17 million Americans could lose health coverage.

Moderate Republicans, particularly those facing tough reelection fights, fear political fallout from slashing healthcare and welfare programs. Meanwhile, fiscal hawks argue that promised savings fall short by hundreds of billions, despite the steep social cuts.

House rules require multiple preliminary votes before final passage, and early warning signs emerged when a routine procedural vote, typically lasting minutes, dragged on for over seven hours, breaking records for the longest vote in House history.

Trump applies pressure, Democrats ready for 2026

Trump, eager to score a legislative win before the July 4 deadline he set, took matters into his own hands. He summoned wavering Republicans to a closed-door meeting at the White House and issued a late-night broadside on his Truth Social platform.

“What are the Republicans waiting for?” he wrote. “What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT'S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!”

While Republicans face internal discord, Democrats are united in their opposition.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries labelled the bill a “disgusting abomination,” accusing the GOP of orchestrating a historic redistribution of wealth from the poor to the wealthy.

With House Republicans hanging by a thread, the bill’s fate remains uncertain. But one thing is clear: Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” has become one big political flashpoint in a deeply fractured party."

Two US contractors who worked at the controversial sites described a disturbing pattern of violence and mismanagement.

They said many of the security guards hired by the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) were poorly trained and operated with little oversight.

""There are innocent people being hurt. Badly. Needlessly,"" one contractor said.

The contractors provided videos showing chaotic crowds pressed between metal gates, with the sound of gunfire and stun grenades echoing in the background.

In some clips, English-speaking men can be heard encouraging each other as shots ring out.

One contractor said live rounds were sometimes fired into the ground or air, but at times directly toward civilians.

He described an incident where a Palestinian man dropped to the ground after a contractor opened fire.

According to internal documents, non-lethal weapons like pepper spray, rubber pellets, and stun grenades were used routinely, even in the absence of physical threats.

During a single food distribution in June, 37 stun grenades, 60 pepper spray canisters, and other crowd-control tools were deployed.

A photo shared by a contractor shows a woman unconscious in a donkey cart, reportedly after being hit in the head by part of a stun grenade.

The GHF, a Delaware-registered nonprofit backed by the Israeli government, was created in February to distribute food in Gaza.

The US pledged $30 million to support its operations, though other funding sources remain unclear.

Journalists are barred from accessing the sites, which are located in Israeli military-controlled areas.

Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company contracted to manage operations, said no serious injuries had occurred and described the measures taken as necessary ""at the height of desperation"" to protect civilians and staff.

But internal SRS documents reviewed by the AP said that people were injured during 31 percent of distributions over a two-week period in June.

The report did not specify the nature or severity of the injuries.

Palestinians attempting to access food from the GHF sites say they are caught between Israeli fire on the roads and American contractors at the gates.

""We have come here to get food for our families. We have nothing,"" one contractor recalled Palestinians telling him.

""Why does the army shoot at us? Why do you shoot at us?""

Surveillance and data concerns

Contractors said surveillance cameras with facial recognition were used to monitor crowds.

They alleged that US and Israeli personnel worked side-by-side in a control room on the Israeli side of the Kerem Abu Salem crossing, cross-referencing faces with known data.

Internal documents referenced a ""POI Mugs Card"" showing individuals deemed suspicious.

Contractors were reportedly told to photograph anyone who looked ""out of place"", though criteria were never defined.

GHF denied using biometrics or collecting intelligence and said it coordinates with Israeli authorities as required.

Contractors described the early stages of the GHF operation as disorganised and unsafe.

Many security personnel were hired just days before deployment, with some lacking military or weapons experience.

Rules of engagement were not shared until after distributions had begun.

Some guards had not even calibrated their weapons, increasing risks of inaccurate fire.

One internal email described the sites as ""not sustainable"" and ""not safe"".

""If operations continue in this manner,"" one contractor warned, ""innocent aid seekers will continue to be needlessly injured. And possibly killed.""

Israel’s genocide in Gaza

Israel has been carrying out a genocide in Gaza since October 2023.

Palestinians have recorded killings of more than 56,500 Palestinians, most of them women and children.

Some 11,000 Palestinians are feared buried under rubble of annihilated homes, according to Palestine's official WAFA news agency.

Experts, however, contend that the actual death toll significantly exceeds what the Gaza authorities have reported, estimating it could be around 200,000.

Washington allocates $3.8 billion in annual military funding to its long-standing ally Israel.

Since October 2023, the US has spent more than $22 billion supporting Israel's genocide in Gaza and wars in neighbouring countries.

Despite senior US officials criticising Israel regarding the high civilian death toll in Gaza, Washington has, thus far, resisted calls to place conditions on any arms transfers."

""I won't go to the details that what's in the in the proposal. But I think the president's message is clear. This is one that has to be accepted because it will only get worse if they (Hamas) don't,"" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told a regular media briefing on Wednesday in Washington.

Asked how is the new proposal different from previous truce deals, she said, ""It's not going to be the world's longest ceasefire.""

""It's going to be peace that's achieved fundamentally by the changes on the ground which we have already seen implemented over the last couple of weeks,"" she said, referring to 12-day Israeli and US strikes on Iran that followed a truce between Tehran and Tel Aviv.

Calling Gaza ""an uninhabitable place"", she said the Palestinians territory needs to be rebuilt ""with the help of Arab partners.""

""We don't have a ceasefire yet. Hopefully, that will change. But that is getting quite ahead of the dynamic in general.""

Trump said on Tuesday that Israel has agreed to ""the necessary conditions"" to finalise a 60-day ceasefire in the besieged enclave, urging Hamas to accept the proposal.

Trump did not detail what conditions were agreed upon by Tel Aviv.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar also said on Wednesday that his country was serious about reaching a truce deal with Hamas, which has confirmed receiving proposals from mediators.

Hamas stated in a statement on Wednesday that it was ""conducting national consultations to discuss"" the proposals.

It stated its aim ""to reach an agreement that guarantees an end to the aggression, secures the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and urgently aids our people in the Gaza Strip"".

Next week, Trump is scheduled to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House.

Occupied West Bank annexation calls

On the issue of Likud ministers exhorting Netanyahu to annex occupied West Bank, Bruce said, ""Our position regarding Israel, the choices it makes, is that we stand with Israel and its decisions and how it views its own internal security.""

Fourteen Israeli ministers and Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana signed a joint letter on Wednesday demanding that Netanyahu immediately annex the occupied territory. Israeli Justice Minister Yariv Levin also joined the calls, saying ""the time for sovereignty has come.""

In a letter addressed to Netanyahu and shared by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich on X, the signatories called on the government ""to apply sovereignty over Judea and Samaria (occupied West Bank) before the end of the Knesset summer session"", which concludes on July 27.

The ministers argued that the current ""strategic partnership and backing and support of the US and President Donald Trump create a favourable time to lead this move (annexation) now""."

The legislation, projected to balloon national debt by up to $3.3 trillion, has enraged fiscal conservatives and triggered warnings of long-term economic pain.

At the heart of the drama is Musk's claim that Trump and Republican leaders have betrayed the core principle of fiscal restraint.

Musk has repeatedly and forcefully denounced Trump's megabill, passed by the Senate and now before the House, as a ""disgusting abomination"" that would plunge the US deeper into debt.In a post on X, the platform he owns, Musk wrote, ""If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day.”

""Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.""He has also floated an X poll to test support for a third party, boasting that more than 80 percent of respondents backed the idea — though critics note the results reflect Musk's own audience, not the broader electorate.

Behind the bluster lies a deeper rift between two former allies.

Musk donated a whopping $300 million to Republican causes in 2024 and once styled himself as a champion of conservative innovation. Over the months, his relationship with Trump has soured, culminating in a bizarre twist: Trump recently hinted Musk could be deported, despite his status as a naturalised US citizen with no criminal charges.

Some see the jab as nothing more than Trumpian theatre. Others hear the undertone of a serious feud brewing beneath the surface.

Noted political analyst Dr Stephen J. Farnsworth, Professor of Political Science at the University of Mary Washington, told TRT World, ""In any competition between Trump and Musk, some form of compromise seems the most likely eventual outcome.""""Musk has too many large government contracts,"" he adds, ""to engage in a full, permanent rupture with a president who is quite willing to set policy in ways designed to punish his critics.""

Yet, Musk seems determined to test the boundaries of political loyalty. His vocal support for Representative Thomas Massie, one of the top Republicans opposing the budget deal, has amplified speculation that Musk is laying the groundwork for a parallel conservative movement.

In the US, every state keeps its gate.

California's, for instance, is ironclad: enroll a third of one percent of voters — roughly 75,000 names — or haul in a petition stacked with 1.1 million signatures to be registered as a political party. To stay in the game, hold that sliver of the electorate or capture two percent in a statewide race. American political observers are watching closely to see if Musk begins recruiting candidates or backing primary challenges in 2026.

Still, the road to a viable third party is long, rough, and littered with the wreckage of failed movements.

""In terms of elections, third parties never last in American politics, unless the third party replaces one of the two dominant parties,"" Farnsworth said. ""If he follows through on his threats, Musk would likely be the latest version of Ross Perot, a prickly billionaire of the 1990s who launched a third party that didn't last long.""

Farnsworth added that third parties can still inflict damage in the short term.

""As the 1992 presidential election demonstrated, third parties can cause trouble for an existing party in the short term. George H.W. Bush lost re-election that year in part because millions of normally Republican voters backed Perot's third-party movement.""

Whether Musk can summon the same disruption remains to be seen.

""Musk may be able to finance primary or third-party challengers and to pick off Republicans here or there who voted for this deal in the 2026 midterm elections,"" said Farnsworth. Overall, though, Republicans are far more likely to back Trump over Musk in any long-running clash between these two men, he adds.

Ballot access, media coverage, candidate recruitment — these are just a few of the hurdles facing Musk. ""Any third party has to spend a huge amount of money,"" Farnsworth said. ""Musk's wealth makes those sorts of things easier. But money alone doesn't guarantee success, as Musk's efforts to influence the Wisconsin Supreme Court elections demonstrated earlier this year.""

In other words, being rich helps. But it's not enough.

Professor David N. Gibbs of the University of Arizona struck a more open note. ""The 'standard' response from most historians is that any notion of a third party in the United States is just a pipe dream. Just look at how stable the two-party system has been for well over a century,"" he told TRT World.

Yet Gibbs senses something is shifting beneath the surface.

""I sense that this time really is different and that a third-party challenge may well be effective in the near future, given how deeply unpopular both parties are right now; a trend that is likely to increase if Trump's economic policies fail to raise living standards,"" he said. ""There are many indications that American politics is entering a period of realignment. A super-rich oligarch like Musk is unlikely to be an effective change agent, but I do sense that fundamental change is in the air.""

As Congress prepares to debate the bill that triggered the billionaire's rebellion, Musk's 'America Party' remains a tantalising idea — a billionaire's bluff or the opening salvo of a new political insurgency.

""Musk may rattle the cage,"" Farnsworth said, ""but he has many irons in the fire with his various businesses and media activities one has to wonder if he may soon tire of the long slog of building a lasting political movement that could effectively challenge Trump Republicans in 2026 and 2028."""

(Google’s parent company), and Amazon.","A UN expert has named over 60 companies, including major arms manufacturers and technology firms, in a report linking their involvement in supporting illegal Zionist settlements in occupied West Bank and ongoing genocide in besieged Gaza.

Italian human rights lawyer Francesca Albanese, UN Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, compiled the report based on over 200 submissions from states, human rights defenders, companies, and academics.

The report, published late on Monday, calls for dozens of companies to cease dealings with Israel and for legal accountability for executives implicated in alleged violations of international law.

""While life in Gaza is being obliterated and the West Bank is under escalating assault, this report shows why Israel's genocide continues: because it is lucrative for many,"" Albanese wrote in the 27-page document.

She accused corporate entities of being ""financially bound to Israel's apartheid and militarism.""

""By shedding light on the political economy of an occupation turned genocidal, the report reveals how the forever-occupation has become the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech . . . while investors and private and public institutions profit freely,"" Albanese wrote in the report.

The report groups the companies by sector, for example military or technology. It said around 15 companies responded directly to Albanese's office but did not publish their replies.

It names arms firms such as Lockheed Martin and Leonardo, saying their weaponry has been used in Gaza genocide. It also lists heavy machinery suppliers Caterpillar Inc and HD Hyundai, claiming their equipment has contributed to property destruction in occupied Palestinian territories.

""Foreign military sales are government-to-government transactions. Discussions about those sales are best addressed by the US government,"" said a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin.

Caterpillar has previously stated it expects its products to be used in line with international humanitarian law.

UN Human Rights Council

Technology giants Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM were named as ""central to Israel's surveillance apparatus and the ongoing Gaza destruction.""

Alphabet has previously defended its $1.2 billion cloud services contract with the Israel's extremist government, stating it is not directed at military or intelligence actions.

Palantir Technologies was also mentioned for providing AI tools to the Israeli military, though specifics on their use were not included.

""There are reasonable grounds to believe Palantir has provided automatic predictive policing technology, core defence infrastructure for rapid and scaled-up construction and deployment of military software, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which allows real-time battlefield data integration for automated decision making,"" the report said.

The report expands on a previous UN database of firms linked to illegal Zionist settlements, last updated in June 2023, adding new companies and detailing ties to the ongoing Gaza genocide.

The report stated these companies are only the beginning. Albanese's office has compiled a database of 1,000 entities from submissions to the investigation.

It will be presented to the 47-member UN Human Rights Council on Thursday.

Although the Council lacks legally binding powers, cases documented by UN investigations have occasionally informed international prosecutions.

Israel and the United States disengaged from the Council earlier this year, falsely claiming bias against Israel.

We will not accept this intimidation,"" says Zohran Mamdani, Democratic nominee for mayor of New York.","The new Democratic nominee for mayor of New York denounced US President Donald Trump’s threat to arrest and deport him, calling the statement “an attack on our democracy” and vowing to “not accept this intimidation.”

“The President of the United States just threatened to have me arrested, stripped of my citizenship, put in a detention camp and deported. Not because I have broken any law but because I will refuse to let ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents) terrorize our city,” Zohran Mamdani wrote on X on Tuesday, referring to ICE’s recent controversial crackdown on irregular immigrants.

Mamdani said the president’s statements represent not only “an attack on our democracy” but also a warning to every New Yorker who refuses to stay silent, adding: “If you speak up, they will come for you. We will not accept this intimidation.”

Mamdani has lived in the US since he was 7 and became a US citizen in 2018.

Earlier, Trump dismissed Mamdani as a “total nut job.” During a roundtable on immigration policy in Florida, when asked about his response to Mamdani’s stance against ICE, Trump replied: “Well, then we’ll have to arrest him.”

US President Donald Trump again vowed on Wednesday to prevent Democratic mayoral nominee for New York City Zohran Mamdani from destroying the city.

""As President of the United States, I'm not going to let this Communist Lunatic destroy New York,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

""Rest assured, I hold all the levers, and have all the cards,"" he said.

He previously threatened to withhold federal funding from New York City if Mamdani does not ""do the right thing"" as mayor. Trump vowed to ""save"" the city, ""just like"" he said he did ""with the Good Ol’ USA!”

Trump has long called for the arrest and jailing of his political opponents, from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to California Governor Gavin Newsom, often without specifying what charges they might face.

The Trump administration's immigrant crackdown has targeted irregular migrants – or those who may look to have a migrant background – but earlier this month told its lawyers to prioritise trying to strip naturalised citizens for alleged criminal offences.

Mamdani defeated former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in last week's Democratic primary – as confirmed this week after rank-choice votes were counted – positioning him to become the Big Apple's first Muslim mayor.

New York leans heavily Democratic, though Mamdani could face an independent candidate challenge from Cuomo or current Mayor Eric Adams, a former Democrat who is seeking reelection.

New York is due to elect its mayor this November 4.

Mamdani has been a vocal supporter of Palestine and a critic of Israel. While in college, he co-founded a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, and in 2023, he joined a hunger strike outside the White House demanding a ceasefire in Gaza."
7/2/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/a66ecffbb4b0,"How Palestinian-Israeli lawmakers are targeted in Knesset for highlighting Muslim plightMembers are victims of what looks like a well-organised attempt at discrimination, stemming from a belief that the parliament belongs to only a section of the population","In the Knesset, the Israeli parliament hailed by the West as a beacon of democracy in the Middle East, a troubling pattern persists: the relentless targeting of Palestinian-Israeli members, particularly those who voice criticism of Israel’s human rights violations in besieged Gaza and the occupied Palestinian territories.

The latest target of this campaign is Ayman Odeh, a leader of the Hadash political alliance who faces imminent expulsion from the Knesset at the hands of his Jewish colleagues.

Far from being an isolated event, the campaign by Jewish members of the Knesset to expel Odeh appears to be well-organised.

“Odeh is not an exception. Every Arab member of the Knesset would tell you that they have suffered incitement and violence,” Sami Abu Shehadeh, a former Knesset member and leader of the Palestinian-Israeli party Balad, tells TRT World, while referring to the commonly used adjective for Palestinian-Israeli lawmakers.

Palestinian-Israelis are a mostly Muslim minority group of 1.6 million citizens, constituting 21 percent of the country’s population. Eight of every 10 Palestinian citizens of Israel are Muslim, while the rest are Christians and Druze.

Calling Israeli democracy an “illusion”, Shehadeh says Palestinian-Israeli representatives in the Knesset are always under attack from their Zionist colleagues.

“There’s an atmosphere that this parliament belongs only to a part of the citizens. That it belongs only to the Jews. And we, the indigenous population, are not considered part of their group,” he says.

On June 30, the Knesset House Committee, which deals with parliamentary rules and rights of its members, voted 14-2 to advance a motion to expel Odeh.

“This is a fascist and racist move… The fight is between equality and Jewish supremacy, and we will never give up that fight,” Odeh wrote in a social media post after the vote.

The campaign to expel Odeh began early this year when he expressed hope for the release of both Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.

Critics — led by Likud Avichai Boaron, a Jewish member of the Knesset — accused Odeh of equating hostages with “terrorists,” garnering 70 signatures to initiate expulsion proceedings.

This expulsion move, which requires 90 votes in parliament to succeed, seems to be in clear violation of Israel’s Basic Law, a set of quasi-constitutional laws that Israel uses in place of a proper constitution.

A Knesset member can be expelled only if they explicitly support armed struggle against the state of Israel — something legal experts say Odeh did not do.

The Adalah, an independent human rights organisation and legal centre in Israel, says the process to expel Odeh from the Knesset is part of an “inciteful, politically motivated campaign” aimed at delegitimising and eliminating Palestinian representation from the Israeli legislature.

Shehadeh says Palestinian-Israeli members of the Knesset have been harassed, hounded and chased away since 1984 when they were first allowed to establish their own parties.

“There has been incitement against our political parties, against our representatives. Sometimes, we are attacked physically. We are attacked verbally all the time,” he says.

Human rights organisations accuse Israel of treating the Palestinian Israelis as second-class citizens and practising “systematic and institutionalised discrimination”.

Palestinian-Israeli legislators have routinely faced relentless scrutiny at the hands of their Jewish colleagues. For example, Azmi Bishara, founder of the Balad party, went into exile in 2007 after being accused of aiding Hezbollah during the Second Lebanon War. He now lives in Qatar.

Similarly, Haneen Zoabi, another member of the Knesset from Balad, was suspended for six months in 2014 for alleged incitement to violence. She upset right-wing colleagues by writing articles that her detractors interpreted as “advice to Hamas” on how to defeat Israel. She faced death threats before ultimately leaving the Knesset in 2019.

Knesset members Ahmad Tibi and Aida Touma-Suleiman, both vocal critics of the Israeli occupation, faced suspensions at different times for criticising Israeli policies in Gaza and occupied Palestinian territories.

Harassment under legal cover

The legal mechanism to enable the expulsion of lawmakers from the Knesset was instituted through the 2016 Suspension Law.

The law, which lets 90 members of the Knesset oust any of their colleagues on mere allegations of incitement or suspected support for armed struggle, was widely criticised as targeting Palestinian-Israeli lawmakers.

The law has opened the door to the “authoritarian control” of the Knesset by allowing its members to oust their colleagues for any “politically-motivated reason” and “without any substantive process”.

More recent legislative proposals aim at lowering the threshold for disqualifying candidates from running for office, targeting Palestinian-Israeli parties for actions like visiting Palestinian prisoners’ families.

The Central Elections Committee, which carries out elections for the Knesset, has repeatedly attempted to ban Palestinian-Israeli candidates, though the Supreme Court sometimes overturn these bans.

Shehadeh says these mechanisms expose Israel’s democratic facade. “Israel is not a normal state. There is no real democracy,” he says.

The reason for the hounding of Palestinian-Israeli lawmakers is that the state of Israel is “built on Jewish superiority”, he says. The Palestinian-Israeli lawmakers strive for equality, which is considered “extreme” by a society increasingly dominated by a right-wing ideology.

Inciting people against Palestinian-Israeli members of the Knesset garners more votes and media attention. “When they spread hatred against us, it brings them a lot of media coverage, more supporters, more followers,” Shehadeh says.

Knesset member Bezalel Smotrich’s remarks in 2021 that Palestinian-Israeli lawmakers were in the legislature “by mistake” as the country’s founder, David Ben-Gurion, “did not finish the job” went unchallenged, which shows the extent to which racist rhetoric has been normalised in Israel, he says.

The consequences extend beyond the Knesset. “(Palestinian-Israeli members) of the Knesset are attacked by Israeli police in all demonstrations. They push us, they attack us physically. They hit us,” he says.

A January 2025 UK Parliament motion condemned the targeting of Palestinian-Israeli members of the Knesset as evidence of an “ethnocratic, apartheid state”.

Amnesty International also condemned discriminatory regulations, noting that inflammatory rhetoric labels Palestinian-Israeli members of the Knesset as “traitors” to delegitimise their work.

“They don’t want to have our voice in the parliament,” Shehadeh says."

The trip, which kicked off on Wednesday, is part of a broader diplomatic tour aimed at strengthening India’s economic and strategic presence in Africa, the Caribbean, and South America, amid rising competition with China and Russia.

During his visit to Accra, Ghana's capital, Modi is scheduled to hold bilateral talks with President John Mahama, who took office earlier this year. The discussions will focus on enhancing trade relations and expanding cooperation across various sectors.

Modi will also address the Ghanaian parliament and meet members of Ghana’s Indian community, which numbers around 15,000, including some families who have lived in the country since its independence nearly 70 years ago.

Ghana, the continent’s largest gold producer and a key player in cocoa exports, remains a strategic partner for India. In the 2024–2025 fiscal year, bilateral trade between the two countries reached $3.1 billion, according to the Indian foreign ministry.

India is currently the top destination for Ghanaian exports, primarily due to its import of Ghanaian gold.

Modi’s stop in Ghana is the first leg of a multi-nation tour that will take him to Trinidad and Tobago, Argentina, Brazil, and Namibia. He is expected to attend the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro on July 6 and 7."

The move on Wednesday drew immediate reactions from both Kiev and Moscow, with the Kremlin hailing the decision as a step toward ending the war.

Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry stressed the “critical importance” of receiving previously approved US military aid, warning that delays could hinder its ability to protect civilians and frontline positions.

Russia, meanwhile, welcomed the reports of halted shipments.

“The fewer weapons are delivered, the sooner the conflict in Ukraine will end,” the Kremlin said, repeating its longstanding position that Western military support prolongs hostilities.

The US pause affects certain air defence munitions previously promised to Ukraine under the administration of former US President Joe Biden.

The Pentagon’s review, conducted under the Trump presidency, determined that stocks of some weapons had fallen to critically low levels and could not be replenished quickly enough without compromising US military readiness.

“This decision was made to put America’s interests first,” White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement. “The strength of the United States Armed Forces remains unquestioned — just ask Iran.”

The shipments are not cancelled but are delayed until US inventories can support both domestic needs and external commitments. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the reassessment was part of a broader recalibration of global defence priorities under Trump’s administration.

Since Russia’s full-scale military campaign in February 2022, the US has provided Ukraine with more than $66 billion in military aid, including long-range missiles, drones, and advanced air defence systems.

The halt, though partial, introduces uncertainty into Ukraine’s supply chain at a time when battlefield dynamics remain volatile."

The current Dalai Lama, the 14th, was born in 1935 as Lhamo Dhondup in Qinghai province, the northeastern part of Tibet, an autonomous region of China.

The Dalai Lama, whose title means “Ocean Leader/Teacher”, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. He was identified at the age of two as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama.

According to the Tibetan tradition, the soul of a senior Buddhist monk is reincarnated to continue his spiritual mission.

How was he selected?

The idea of recognising and confirming a Dalai Lama’s reincarnation started in the 15th century when Gedun Gyatso, the 2nd Dalai Lama, was identified as the rebirth of Gedun Drub, the 1st Dalai Lama. It was then that the Dalai Lama’s institution, Gaden Phodrang Labrang, was established.

Since then, a series of “unmistaken reincarnations” has been recognised in the lineage of the Dalai Lama, according to the Dalai Lama’s website.

The current Dalai Lama – Lhamo Dhondup – was selected by a group of high-ranking monks who are guided by “visions and spiritual signs”.

He was officially lodged at the Potala Palace in Lhasa in 1940 as the spiritual leader.

Regarding the selection of his successor, the Dalai Lama said that the process will follow the same traditional Tibetan Buddhist rituals.

Where’s the new Dalai Lama?

In his book ""Voice for the Voiceless"", released in March 2025, the Dalai Lama said his successor would be born outside China.

The Dalai Lama has lived in exile in northern India since 1959, after fleeing a failed uprising against Beijing’s rule.

In a speech in 2011, the Dalai Lama mentioned how highly enlightened Buddhists can ""manifest an emanation before death"".

Some experts have speculated that it might mean the Dalai Lama possibly suggesting he could train a successor in his lifetime, but Tibetan officials say that is unlikely.

In a statement released ahead of his 90th birthday, the Dalai Lama declared that the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a non-profit organisation he established, has the sole authority to recognise his reincarnation.

“No one else has any authority to interfere in this matter,” he said, underlining that all powers and verification procedures to identify the next Dalai Lama will remain under the Trust’s control.

Beijing rejects the Dalai Lama’s statement that his successor will be born outside China, asserting its exclusive authority to approve the next Dalai Lama based on imperial-era practices..

Beijing bases this claim on a 1793 Qing dynasty ritual involving the drawing of names from a golden urn.

China calls the current Dalai Lama as a “separatist” and strictly bans public displays of his image or devotion within Tibetan regions.

Tibetan Buddhist leaders in exile have accused Beijing of politicising the reincarnation process, warning of the risk of two rival Dalai Lamas emerging.

In his book, the Dalai Lama asked Tibetans not to accept ""a candidate chosen for political ends by anyone, including those in the People's Republic of China,"" referring to the country by its official name.

In March 2025, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the Dalai Lama was a political exile with ""no right to represent the Tibetan people at all"".

China denies suppressing the rights of the Tibetan people and claims that its rule ended serfdom there and brought prosperity to the poor region."

The suspects, identified as Yuance Chen, 38, and Liren “Ryan” Lai, 39, were arrested on Friday and made their initial court appearances Monday in Houston, Texas and Portland, Oregon, respectively.

They are accused of conducting covert intelligence operations inside the United States on behalf of China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS), the country's primary civilian intelligence agency.

According to prosecutors, Chen and Lai allegedly attempted to obtain classified US military information, gather US Navy intelligence, and recruit active-duty military personnel to assist Chinese intelligence efforts.

‘Aggressive effort to undermine security’

Attorney General Pamela Bondi described the case as part of a broader strategy by Beijing to compromise American defence from within.

“This case underscores the Chinese government’s sustained and aggressive effort to infiltrate our military and undermine our national security from within,” Bondi said in a statement.

FBI Director Kash Patel echoed the Justice Department's concerns, emphasising the bureau’s ongoing efforts to disrupt foreign intelligence threats targeting the United States.

“We will continue to vigilantly defend the homeland from China’s pervasive attempts to infiltrate our borders,” Patel said.

The move was driven by the Pentagon’s policy chief, Elbridge Colby, following a review of stockpile levels that raised alarms about dwindling reserves of artillery rounds, air defence interceptors and other advanced munitions, three people familiar with the matter told the outlet.

Although the decision was made in early June, it is only now taking effect — just as Ukraine faces some of the heaviest Russian aerial assaults of the three-year war, including a weekend barrage involving more than 470 drones and 60 missiles.

Ukraine’s military says 249 of the projectiles were shot down, while 226 were neutralised, likely through electronic jamming.

The attacks targeted Kiev and other civilian areas across the country.

The halt in shipments has reportedly sparked concern among Ukraine’s supporters in the US Congress that the country could be left exposed to further Russian airstrikes.

The suspended munitions are part of two main streams of US military aid.

One includes direct drawdowns from existing Pentagon stockpiles—funded with replenishment money—while the other uses the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative to fund purchases from US defence contractors.

According to the report, all funding under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative was allocated by the end of the Biden administration, though deliveries continue as systems are completed.

The current Trump administration is using the remainder of a $61 billion aid package to replenish US stockpiles and support other partners, including Israel.

However, it has not requested additional funding for Ukraine.

An administration official told Politico that the remaining funds should last Ukraine several more months.

The Pentagon and White House declined to comment on the report."

Results of the city's ranked choice voting tabulation were released on Tuesday and showed Mamdani trouncing Cuomo by 12 percentage points.

In a statement, Mamdani said he was humbled by the support he received in the primary and started turning his attention to the general election.

""Last Tuesday, Democrats spoke in a clear voice, delivering a mandate for an affordable city, a politics of the future, and a leader unafraid to fight back against rising authoritarianism,"" he said.

""I am humbled by the support of more than 545,000 New Yorkers who voted for our campaign and am excited to expand this coalition even further as we defeat Eric Adams and win a city government that puts working people first.""

'People in New York are crazy'

US President Donald Trump, meanwhile continued his attacks on the New York City mayoral candidate as a ""total nut job.""

""Frankly, I've heard he's a total nut job,"" Trump told reporters.

""I think the people in New York are crazy because they go this route. I think they're crazy. We will have a communist in the… for the first time, really a pure, true communist. He wants to operate the grocery stores. The department stores. What about the people that are there? I think it's crazy.""

The Democratic nominee has been a vocal supporter of Palestine and a critic of Israel.

He co-founded the Bowdoin College chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, and in 2023, he joined a hunger strike outside the White House demanding end to Israeli genocide in Gaza.

Mamdani, a self-identified democratic socialist, told NBC News on Sunday that mayors should not ""police speech"" when he was asked to condemn the ""Globalise the intifada"" phrase.

In the same interview he said doesn't believe billionaires should exist, ""because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality, and ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country.""

On Tuesday, Trump repeated his false claim that Mamdani is a ""communist.""

""I think he's terrible. He's a communist. The last thing we need is a communist. I said there will never be socialism in the United States,” he said. “I think he's bad news and I think I'm going to have a lot of fun with him, watching him, because he has to come right to this building to get his money. Don't worry, he's not going to run away with anything.”

Speaking at a roundtable on immigration policy in the state of Florida, Trump was asked about his message to Mamdani, who recently pledged to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests, and defy Trump’s deportation plans.

""Well, then we'll have to arrest him,"" said Trump.

""We don't need a communist in this country, but if we have one, I'm going to be watching over him very carefully on behalf of the nation,"" he added.

Mamdani, who declared victory the night of the June 24 primary, will face a general election field that includes incumbent Mayor Eric Adams as well as independent candidate Jim Walden and Republican Curtis Sliwa.

Cuomo conceded defeat just hours after the polls closed last week but is contemplating whether to run in the general election on an independent ballot line.

After the release of Tuesday's vote count, Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said ""We’ll be continuing conversations with people from all across the city while determining next steps.""

""Extremism, division and empty promises are not the answer to this city’s problems, and while this was a look at what motivates a slice of our primary electorate, it does not represent the majority,"" Azzopardi said.

Experts, however, contend that the actual death toll significantly exceeds what the Gaza authorities have reported, estimating it could be around 200,000.

Last November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.

Washington allocates $3.8 billion in annual military funding to its long-standing ally Israel.

Since October 2023, the US has spent more than $22 billion supporting Israel's genocide in Gaza and wars in neighbouring countries.

Despite senior US officials criticising Israel regarding the high civilian death toll in Gaza, Washington has, thus far, resisted calls to place conditions on any arms transfers.

Netanyahu, a habitual saboteur

Netanyahu has a record of torpedoing Gaza ceasefire agreements.

In March 2025, Netanyahu after nearly two months of relative peace in the besieged enclave, shattered the ceasefire.

In July 2024, Netanyahu scrapped a potential hostage swap deal to appease his far-right allies.

Netanyahu turned down yet another ceasefire plan — this time put forward by Hamas —in the second week of February, 2024.

During a brief ceasefire in November 2023, mediators secured a four-day truce, resulting in the release of 50 Israeli captives and 150 Palestinian detainees.

However, Netanyahu's extremist regime ended the pause after just a week, citing military priorities.

Trump has previously urged Israel to ""make the deal in Gaza,"" but on the ground, Israel has continued to pursue its genocide across the Palestinian territory.

The end of Israel's 12-day war with Iran — which followed a US bombing mission on Tehran's nuclear sites — has provided a window of opportunity for a deal, with Trump keen to add another peace agreement to a series of recent deals he has brokered."
7/1/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/e5b3e08df739,Iran after Khamenei: A look at the men tipped to succeed the Supreme LeaderThe recent Israeli-US strikes on Iran have raised the stakes for Ali Khamenei. Experts lay out the election process for the next supreme leader and the potential candidates.,"In the middle of the 12-day conflict with Israel, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei allegedly named a few people who could be his successor, shining a rare spotlight on a complicated process that goes into electing the political and spiritual head of the Shia-majority nation.

As the dust settles after the intense military face-off between the two arch-enemies, speculations swirl over the people who could succeed the 86-year-old cleric, who has led the country uninterrupted since the 1989 death of Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran’s first post-revolutionary supreme leader and the central figure in the 1979 purge.

Iran formed a complicated political structure synthesising democratic rules with Shia theocratic principles after its landmark 1979 Revolution, which toppled the country’s monarchical system under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

The country’s Assembly of Experts, a religious authority comprising top Shia clerics, is one of those institutions created by the revolution, which will decide the identity of the next supreme leader after the incumbent Ali Khamenei.

Mohammed Eslami, an Iranian academic and a professor of international relations at the University of Minho, however, refuses to read too much into the recent reports, which claim that Khamenei nominated three possible candidates to replace him.

“The Supreme Leader himself does not interfere in the process of electing the next leader. So, the claim that Khamenei has nominated three individuals as his successors seems invalid to me,” Eslami tells TRT World.

Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei goes through one of his toughest times in his career after Israeli-US strikes on nuclear facilities of Tehran.

How is the supreme leader elected?

“Contrary to common belief,” Eslami says, “the election of the Supreme Leader in Iran follows a ‘semi-democratic’ process.”

Every four years, citizens across all cities and towns vote to elect members of the Assembly of Experts (Majles-e Khobregan), a body of Islamic jurists who meet specific scholarly and political qualifications.”

The Assembly of Experts, whose members have an eight-year term, has 88 religious jurists (faqihs in Arabic). While they are elected by popular vote, the official candidacy of these religious jurists should be approved by the Guardian Council, a 12-member top council, which also vets candidates for presidential, parliamentary and local elections alike.

The Guardian Council, a semi-democratic authority, six of whose members are elected by the supreme leader and the rest by the parliament, can also veto parliamentary legislation and oversee elections, a crucial task.

“Once elected, the assembly carries several responsibilities, the most significant being the evaluation of the current Supreme Leader’s competency to remain in office and, when necessary, the selection of a new Supreme Leader—either upon the death of the incumbent or a determination that he is no longer fit to serve,” says Eslami.

While the public does not directly choose the Supreme Leader, the indirect mechanism through elected representatives introduces a layer of democratic participation into an otherwise clerical system, according to Eslami.

But who are the top candidates for the supreme leadership?

Many pundits have argued that Mojtaba Khamenei, the son of the Supreme Leader, and Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of Khomeini, as possible powerful candidates for the top religious post. But Eslami differs from these assessments, saying that the current Iranian leadership does not favour a dynastic rule.

Mojtaba, son of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, center, attends the annual Quds, or Jerusalem Day rally in Tehran, Iran in 2019.

After the 2024 helicopter crash of then-president Ebrahim Raisi, who was considered a front-runner for the supreme leader post, the Assembly of Experts publicly named Mojtaba Khamenei as one of the candidates.

“In response, the office of Khamenei objected to this notion, clearly stating that the Leader opposes Mojtaba’s candidacy, emphasising that governance of an Islamic society should not be treated as an inherited position like the throne of a monarchy,” says Eslami.

“This rare and direct rejection reinforces the principle that succession must follow the institutional process defined by the Assembly of Experts, not personal or familial preference,” he adds.

A Tehran-based analyst, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also feels that Khamenei’s son has little chance of making it to the top.

“Mojtaba is one of the potential candidates, but as far as I can see, he doesn't have that much chance, as it is not acceptable to change the Velayet-i Faqih to a monarchy,” she adds.

The Velayat-i Faqih is a religio-political theory of Khomeini, promoting the idea that Shia clerics should dominate politics. Velayet-i Faqih is the dominating ideology of the current Iranian statecraft.

Here’s a look at some other people who could succeed Khamenei when the time comes.

Among others, Eslami points to 63-year-old cleric Mirbagheri as a potential candidate for the next supreme leader. Mirbagheri, a member of the Assembly of Experts who was elected from Iran’s northern Semnan province, now serves as the head of the Qom Academy of Islamic Sciences.

Mehdi Mirbagheri is a leading contender for Iran's next supreme leader.

“He is often referred to by regime supporters as one of the ‘theoreticians of the 1979 Revolution’,” says Eslami, referring to Mirbagheri’s efforts to synthesise revolutionary political ideas with Shia religious thought.

“While it is difficult to determine who currently has the upper hand, Mirbagheri appears to be a frontrunner due to both ideological alignment and institutional standing,” he says.

The 67-year-old cleric currently serves as deputy chairman of the Assembly of Experts. Arafi, who represents Tehran in the Assembly, has also been a member of the powerful Guardian Council.

Eslami sees Arafi as one of the strong contenders for supreme leadership.

Arafi, whose father was a close friend of Khomeini, earlier led the Friday prayers in the holy city of Qom, a prestigious position for the Shia religious establishment.

Ameli, an ethnic Azerbaijani from Ardabil, a northwestern province of Iran, is “a unique profile”, according to Eslami. The 63-year-old Ameli is currently the Friday prayer leader of the Azerbaijani-majority province of Ardabil.

He is “a vocal figure on regional issues, particularly concerning Azerbaijan and President Ilham Aliyev”, says Eslami. During the past Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict in the Karabakh region, Ameli gave sermons backing Baku against Yerevan saying that the region is a territory of Islam.

Hassan Ameli is an ethnic Azerbaijani from Ardabil, a northwestern province of Iran.

Like Ameli, Khamenei and current President Masoud Pezeshkian also have Turkic ancestry.

There has been an ongoing public campaign in Iran promoting the former two-term President Hassan Rouhani, a reformist, as a potential candidate for the supreme leadership.

“Rouhani is trying his chances over this matter,” says the Tehran-based analyst, adding that “all of these forecasts might be irrelevant when the time comes.”

Rouhani was a member of the Assembly of Experts in the past. Despite the pro-Rouhani online chatter, Eslami dismisses the idea that the former president can be elected as the country’s next supreme leader.

“Such social media campaigns seem fleeting and unrealistic; given his moderate, pro-Western stance, it is highly unlikely he would be seriously considered for a role that demands deep ideological consistency with the regime’s core principles,” he says."

The court accepted charges against Paetongtarn over her phone call with Cambodian strongman Hun Sen for deliberation and suspended her from duty as prime minister.

A group of 36 senators had filed the charges, accepted by all nine members of the court, accusing her of ""gross ethical misconduct and dishonesty"" in connection with the call.

During the phone call between Paetongtarn and Cambodian Senate head Hun Sen, the Thai leader allegedly criticised her country’s military, specifically the 2nd Army Region commander, over escalating border tensions with Cambodia.

Paetongtarn's suspension came hours after King Maha Vajiralongkorn endorsed a reshuffle in the Cabinet following the exit of a key party from the ruling coalition.

Thai PM ‘accepts’ court decision suspending her

The Thai PM, meanwhile, said she accepts the Constitutional Court's decision to suspend her from her premiership pending a case seeking her dismissal.

""I want to apologise to people who are upset by all of this,"" she told reporters, ""I will continue to work for the country as a Thai citizen.""

Paetongtarn, 38, the daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was elected Thailand's youngest and only second female prime minister last August.

Two of the nine justices voted against suspending her.

Deputy Prime Minister and Transport Minister Suriya Jungrungreangkit will serve as acting prime minister until the royal endorsement of Phumtham Wechayachai as deputy prime minister and interior minister, set for Thursday.

In the changed Cabinet, Paetongtarn was set to serve as culture minister and endorsement is set for the same day, but it remains unclear whether the top court order affects that role.

The eight new nominations for the Cabinet became necessary after the Bhumjaithai Party, the second-largest partner in the previous ruling bloc, withdrew its support last month.

Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia have been simmering since May 28, when troops exchanged fire along the frontier, leaving one Cambodian soldier dead.

The two Southeast Asian nations have since closed their borders."

“I don’t expect negotiations to resume immediately,” Araghchi told CBS News on Tuesday.

“Before we decide to reengage, we need assurance that America will not return to targeting us militarily while discussions are ongoing. Considering all factors, more time is necessary,” he said.

The comments come amid ongoing diplomatic exchanges following a 12-day conflict that brought the region to the brink of a broader war.

On Monday, the White House confirmed talks between US President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Iranian officials, signalling cautious progress toward easing tensions.

‘A matter of national pride and glory’

Araghchi reiterated Iran’s firm stance on its nuclear programme, describing it as “a matter of national pride and glory” that Tehran will “not easily back down from.”

He also underscored Iran’s demonstrated capability to defend itself during the recent hostilities.

“We proved during this 12-day imposed war that we can protect our sovereignty,” he said.

“Should aggression resume, we will respond decisively.”

The conflict erupted on June 13 when Israel launched air strikes targeting Iranian military, nuclear, and civilian sites within its borders, killing at least 935 people and injuring over 5,300, according to Iran’s Health Ministry.

In retaliation, Iran fired missiles and drones at Israeli targets, resulting in at least 29 deaths and over 3,400 injuries, figures released by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem showed.

The crisis escalated further when the United States conducted air strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, intensifying fears of a wider regional war.

A US-brokered ceasefire took effect on June 24, bringing a temporary halt to hostilities as diplomatic efforts continue to seek a long-term resolution."

In a memo issued on Monday, Trump gave his Cabinet 30 days to evaluate sanctions and recommend tougher options, specifically targeting sectors that benefit Cuba’s government, military, and intelligence services.

The directive calls for reviewing Cuba’s treatment of dissidents and aims to curb financial transactions that ""disproportionately benefit the Cuban government... at the expense of the Cuban people.""

Among the potential changes is a move to halt all tourism to the island and restrict educational travel to groups organized and led exclusively by US citizens.

The policy shift aligns with Trump’s stated position to reverse the diplomatic and economic opening toward Havana initiated under former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

In one of his final acts in office, Biden had removed Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism.

Economic embargo, travel restrictions

According to a White House fact sheet, Trump’s memo supports maintaining the US economic embargo on Cuba and rejects international calls to lift it — including at the United Nations.

The Trump administration has also taken broader actions affecting Cuba, including visa restrictions on Cuban and foreign officials linked to Cuba’s overseas medical missions, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio has described as ""forced labour.""

It also revoked temporary protections for around 300,000 Cubans living in the US, removing safeguards against deportation.

Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Fernandez de Cossio condemned the US approach in a recent interview with The Associated Press, accusing Washington of discrediting Cuban medical programs and reversing efforts to welcome Cuban migrants.

Russia currently controls more than 113,000 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and large portions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, as well as areas of Kharkiv, Sumy and Dnipropetrovsk."

A third rocket landed in a residential neighbourhood, causing material damage but no injuries, the sources added on Monday.

The targeted area includes military installations used by the Iraqi Army and federal police.

""One rocket landed between the first and second runways at the airbase,"" Iraq’s official news agency reported, citing a security source who requested anonymity due to restrictions on speaking to the media.

Another rocket struck a house in the al-Orouba (Uruba) neighbourhood, damaging the building but causing no casualties.

A fourth rocket reportedly failed to detonate.

Kirkuk International Airport said there was no disruption to air traffic and confirmed no damage to its facilities.

No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Iraq has seen sporadic rocket and drone attacks in recent years, often attributed to armed groups operating amid long-running tensions between regional powers.

Just days earlier, unidentified drones targeted radar systems at two Iraqi military bases in Baghdad and southern Iraq, shortly before a ceasefire ended a 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel.

The Iraqi government said it has launched an investigation into the recent spate of attacks but has yet to name any perpetrators."

In an executive order signed on Monday, Trump ended a ""national emergency"" in place since 2004 that imposed sweeping sanctions on Syria, affecting most state-run institutions including the central bank.

""This is in an effort to promote and support the country's path to stability and peace,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.

She said the United States will still maintain sanctions on elements of the former regime including Bashar al-Assad, who fled to Russia late last year.

Trump lifted most sanctions against Syria in May, responding to appeals from Saudi Arabia and Türkiye after Ahmed al Sharaa ended a half-century of rule by the Assad family.

Syria recently carried out its first electronic transfer through the international banking system since around the time it descended into a brutal civil war in 2011.

Israel kept pounding civilian and military sites in its historic adversary after the fall of Assad.

But Israel said earlier on Monday that it was interested in normalising ties with Syria as well as Lebanon. Neither Syria nor Lebanon officially recognise Israel.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar vowed on Monday to maintain Israel's grip on the occupied Syrian Golan Heights under any future peace agreement with Syria.

""Israel ruled over the Golan Heights more than 40 years ago, and it will remain as part of Israel under any peace agreement,"" Sa’ar said at a joint press conference with his Austrian counterpart, Beate Meinl-Reisinger, in West Jerusalem.

""We have an interest in including countries such as our neighbours Syria and Lebanon into the circle of peace and normalisation,"" based on the so-called ""Abraham Accords"", he added, without elaborating.

On Sunday, Trump said that some countries expressed interest in joining the normalisation agreements between Arab countries and Israel.

In 2020, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco signed US-sponsored agreements to normalise relations with Israel.

Since 1967, Israel has occupied the majority of Syria's Golan Heights.

After the fall of Assad regime last year, Tel Aviv expanded its occupation into the Syrian so-called “buffer zone” and declared the 1974 Disengagement Agreement with Syria defunct."

The procedural tally: 51 to 49, two Republican defections already scored — but final passage still hangs on the narrowest of margins.

Trump insists the bill reach his desk by July 4, a fireworks‑framed signing meant to erase memories of the Obamacare collapse eight years ago.

His advisers whisper of two harder deadlines: the imminent lapse of his 2017 tax cuts, and a debt‑ceiling cliff that Treasury says could arrive by August if a borrowing boost isn’t stitched into the bill's guts.

Twice in twenty‑four hours, the president softened, then re‑posted, his ultimatum. But the signal was unmistakable: deliver, or explain why a Republican Congress fumbled the centrepiece of his second‑term agenda.

Trump’s domestic legacy is on the line as US Senate navigates final votes on sweeping bill. / Photo: AFP

What sits inside the beast

Permanent tax cuts and new perks. The bill locks in Trump's 2017 rate reductions, scraps federal tax on tips and overtime, and adds a $4,000 senior deduction.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) pegs the ten‑year hole at nearly $3.3 trillion.

Border money by the freight‑train‑load. Roughly $150-200 billion for walls, detention beds, and a hiring spree of immigration agents — including $46.5 billion for 700 new miles of steel and concrete.

Safety‑net surgery. Work rules so strict they may bump 12 million Americans from Medicaid and more than 2 million from food stamps, according to CBO tables doing quiet rounds on Capitol Hill.

Fossil‑fuel first. A slow kill of Biden‑era clean‑energy credits and an express lane for oil and gas permits — cheered in West Texas.

Republicans are selling the package as a blue‑collar boon. The idea, they say, is to make sure hardworking people can keep more of their money, secure the border for generations, and ""unleash American energy"".The no‑tax‑on‑tips line polls well with waitstaff and bartenders; the overtime break sweetens pay cheques for factory swing shifts.

Inside the Oval Office, aides describe the bill as political Kevlar: proof Trump can still cut taxes, still build walls, still bend Washington to his will.

Rebellion in GoP ranks

But cracks shimmer beneath the gilding. Kentucky's Republican Rand Paul calls the deficit math ""debt on steroids"" and vows to vote no. North Carolina's Republican Thom Tillis, spooked by the hit to rural hospitals, not only opposed the motion to proceed but stunned colleagues by announcing his retirement — handing Democrats a tempting Senate pickup in 2026.

Maine's GoP stalwart Susan Collins has signaled she's ""deeply troubled"" by the Medicaid language. Meanwhile, half a dozen House Republicans from high‑tax states like New York and California threaten to sink any bill that doesn’t raise the cap on state‑and‑local tax deductions.

Freedom Caucus hardliners want sharper cuts. Centrists want fewer.

Whether the feuding wings of Republicans can reconcile is the question ricocheting through Senate corridor whispers.

Ledger of winners and losers

Analysts at the Penn-Wharton Budget Model find the top ten percent of earners stand to gain an average $12,000 a year, while the bottom tenth loses $1,600 once benefit trims are factored in.

Americans generally oppose but are largely unfamiliar with the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" according to a new Washington Post/Ipsos poll.Democrats are pouncing.

""It's a massive giveaway to the wealthy, paid for by ripping coverage from rural and working families,"" Senator Mark Warner said over the weekend, warning that the bill will become ""a political albatross"" in 2026.

Can it clear Congress?

Reconciliation means Republicans need 50 Senate votes, plus Vice President JD Vance. They have 49 firm yeses. Lose two more and it crumbles.

In the House, the margin is razor thin. Speaker Mike Johnson can spare no more than three defections once the Senate sends it back with edits.

Staffers talk of tucking controversial items into post‑passage regulatory guidance — a classic Washington workaround that incenses transparency watchdogs but often convinces fence-sitting votes.

If the bill passes, Trump will have written his creed: low taxes, hard borders, fossil dominance into statutory granite. Not easily unpicked by future Democrats.

But the CBO says the deficit surge doesn’t flatten after 2034. Interest payments alone could devour discretionary spending for decades. Should health-coverage losses hit 12 million, every shuttered rural hospital will carry Trump’s imprint.

Some Republicans sense the danger. Campaign ads write themselves: grainy clips of empty clinics, a rising debt ticker.

Still, they remember 2017 — the pain of failing to repeal Obamacare, the base demoralised, the mid-term carnage.

The long night ahead

Into this confusion, Elon Musk glides in posting on X: President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" will ""destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!""

The make-or-break vote may come in the next 10-12 hours. Across Independence Avenue, the Trump team awaits the signing stage. The bunting is on order. The pen tray is polished.

Trump is meeting with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson at the White House today to discuss Republicans’ efforts to pass his sweeping tax cuts and spending package in time for him to sign it by the Fourth of July, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.

Whether Trump strides out into patriotic glory on July 4 or fumes at yet another missed legacy moment will depend on a few weary senators, three swing‑district congressmen, and a thousand pages of legislative fine print.

The fireworks, for now, remain boxed. The summer heat is on, literally and metaphorically. The storm outside the Capitol looms.

Inside, it's just beginning."

""It's very simple. Prime Minister Carney and Canada caved to President Trump and the United States of America,"" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a daily briefing.

Leavitt said Trump ""knows how to negotiate,"" adding that ""every country on the planet needs to have good trade relationships with the United States.""

""And it was a mistake for Canada to vow to implement that tax that would have hurt our tech companies here in the United States.""

Canada announced late Sunday that it would rescind taxes impacting US tech firms and said trade negotiations with Washington would resume.

The digital services tax, enacted last year, would have seen US service providers such as Alphabet and Amazon on the hook for a multi-billion-dollar payment in Canada by Monday.

But Trump, who has weaponised US economic power in the form of tariffs, abruptly said on Friday that he was ending trade talks with Canada in retaliation for the levy.

Then over the weekend Trump revived his rhetoric about wanting Canada to become the 51st US state, which had strained ties between the two countries.

'We don't rely on Canada'

""Frankly, Canada should be the 51st state, okay? It really should, because Canada relies entirely on the United States. We don't rely on Canada,"" Trump told Fox News show ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

The blow-up over the tech tariffs came despite what had been warming relations between Trump and Carney.

The Canadian leader came to the White House on May 6 and had a cordial meeting with Trump in the Oval Office.

They met again at the Group of Seven summit earlier this month in Canada, where leaders pushed Trump to back away from his punishing trade war.

A July 9 deadline that Trump has set for countries to negotiate trade deals is now rapidly approaching before harsh tariffs kick in.

""He is going to set the rates for many of these countries if they don't come to the table to negotiate in good faith, and he is meeting with his trade team this week to do that,"" Leavitt said."

In his speech after a Cabinet meeting in Ankara on Monday, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said they are pleased with the progress made in a short time as part of the terror-free Türkiye process.

""It appears that certain elements within our country and within the organisation (PKK terror group) are pursuing sabotage efforts aimed at dynamiting progress. Our state will not fall into traps,"" Erdogan added.

""The recent incidents that have occurred in our region have confirmed how accurate and strategic this step has been,"" Erdogan added.

The terrorist organisation PKK, responsible for decades of bloodshed and violence, hasannounced that it is disbanding and laying down arms following a congress held from May 5–7 in northern Iraq.

The PKK terror group has long posed a major threat to Türkiye’s national security and regional stability.

Ankara has consistently emphasised that no terror group has a place within or around Türkiye’s borders, and that the only acceptable outcome is the full elimination of terrorist activity through unconditional disarmament and dissolution.

The PKK is recognised as a terrorist organisation by Türkiye, the EU, the US, NATO, and several other countries around the world. Over 40 years, the terror group has been responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of children, women and men."

Known as a ""vote-a-rama,"" Monday's session allows senators to offer unlimited tweaks to the 940-page text for floor votes, meaning the process can extend well beyond 12 hours.

Even then, the Senate bill will have to pass a separate vote in the House of Representatives, where Republicans also have a narrow majority.

Trump wants what he calls the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" to extend his expiring first-term tax cuts at a cost of $4.5 trillion to the budget, boost military spending and fund his plans for unprecedented mass deportations and border security.

Yet even as the process reaches its climax, Republican meeting rooms are still reverberating with bitter rows over the deep cuts to welfare programmes planned to offset the bill's massive costs.

Senators eyeing 2026 mid-term congressional elections are divided over savings that would strip some $1 trillion in subsidised health care from millions of the poorest Americans and add more than $3.3 trillion to the nation's already yawning budget deficit over a decade.

Trump wants to have the package on his desk by the time Independence Day festivities begin on Friday.

""ONE GREAT BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL, is moving along nicely!"" he posted on his Truth Social platform late on Sunday.

Given Trump's iron grip on the party, he is expected to get what he wants in the Senate where Republicans hold a razor-tight majority, while Democrats will overwhelmingly vote no.

It will be a huge win for the Republican leader — who has been criticised for imposing many of his priorities through executive orders that sidestep the scrutiny of Congress.

But the vote on final passage will still be a nail-biter and can only take place after a marathon series of attempted amendments.

""Democrats are really trying to slow roll this as much as possible and to try and get members of the Republican Party to kind of vote on amendments that would be difficult for Republicans to explain when mid-term elections come around,"" TRT World's Craig Boswell said.

Trump's heavy pressure to declare victory has put more vulnerable Republicans in a difficult position.

Nonpartisan studies have concluded that the bill would ultimately pave the way for a historic redistribution of wealth from the poorest 10 percent of Americans to the richest.

And cuts to the Medicaid programme — which helps low-income Americans get coverage in a country with notoriously expensive medical insurance — and cuts to the Affordable Care Act would result in nearly 12 million more uninsured people by 2034, independent analysis shows.

Senate Democrats are expected to focus their amendments on highlighting the threats to health care, as well as cuts to federal food aid programs and clean energy tax credits.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune can only lose one more vote with conservative Rand Paul and moderate Thom Tillis already on the record as Republican rebels.

Tillis, who has announced his retirement and no longer has to worry about reelection in 2026, delivered two fiery floor speeches on Sunday slamming the phase-outs of clean energy tax credits and accusing Republicans of ""betraying"" Trump's promise not to touch Medicaid.

A House vote on the Senate bill could come as early as Wednesday.

However, Republicans there face an equally tight vote-count, with ultra-conservative fiscal hawks complaining that the bill would not cut enough spending and moderates worried at the defunding of Medicaid.

World's richest person and former top Trump advisor Elon Musk — who fell out with the president over the bill — said the Senate text was ""utterly insane"" for seeking to gut government subsidies for clean energy.

""It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,"" said Musk, who is the world's richest person, and heads electric vehicle company Tesla and space flight firm SpaceX, among others."

Speaking after he met with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy in the Turkish capital on Monday, Fidan said Ankara and London are two strategic partners sharing common objectives on several key issues.

“We are both NATO member countries, not part of the EU but maintaining strong ties with Europe,” he noted.

Fidan underlined the strong cooperation between the two countries in areas such as economy, defence, and technology, adding: “Our bilateral trade volume is steadily approaching the target of $30 billion.”

Updating Free Trade Agreement

“This is a goal we’ve pursued with strong determination in recent years,” he stressed.

He added that both nations have made considerable efforts on this matter and highlighted that updating the existing Free Trade Agreement is essential to unlock further trade and investment opportunities.

The foreign minister highlighted the ongoing efforts in defence, saying: “Our cooperation in the defence industry is progressing remarkably well.”

“From Eurofighter procurement to other joint projects, our companies and institutions are working efficiently,” he said.

He further noted that the two countries’ foreign policy perspectives align on many global matters, including the war in Gaza, Syria, Iran, Iraq, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, adding that both sides support a ceasefire between Moscow and Kiev.

Speaking again about the Israel-Iran conflict, the Turkish foreign minister stated: ""Ensuring that the agreement between Iran and Israel is upheld, that the ceasefire is not violated, and that this leads to a lasting peace is currently one of our most important strategic goals.""

“On the other hand, it’s also crucial for us to see an end to the tragedy in Gaza through a ceasefire and a solution based on the two-state formula,” he pointed out.

Fidan also thanked Lammy for the UK’s decision to lift sanctions on Syria.

""They also agreed to visit Syria soon. This is an important area of cooperation for us,"" he said, adding that stability and security in Syria will benefit not only the region but the entire global community.

“We will continue our collaboration in this area,” he concluded.

The three nations issued a joint statement on Monday, urging Tehran to ensure the safety of IAEA personnel and resume full cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog.

“We call on Iranian authorities to refrain from any steps to cease cooperation with the IAEA,” the joint statement read.

“We urge Iran to immediately resume full cooperation in line with its legally binding obligations, and to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety and security of IAEA personnel.”

The nature of the alleged ‘threat’ was not explained.

Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei rejected the call, arguing that the West’s expectations were unrealistic following the recent strikes by Israel and the US on Iranian nuclear facilities.

""How can they expect us to ensure the safety and security of the agency's inspectors when Iran's peaceful nuclear facilities were attacked a few days ago?"" Baghaei said during a news conference in Tehran.

IAEA vote and new Iranian law deepen divide

Tensions between Iran and the UN nuclear agency have escalated since the IAEA board voted earlier this month to declare Iran in violation of its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).

Iranian officials have linked this resolution to the justification for the Israeli-led attacks on its nuclear infrastructure.

Baghaei pointed to a newly enacted law approved by Iran’s Guardian Council that mandates the suspension of cooperation with the IAEA. He also criticised the UN watchdog for failing to condemn the strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, arguing that such silence undermines the agency’s credibility.

""Iran shouldn't be expected to accept its obligations under the NPT when the UN nuclear watchdog has stopped short of condemning the attacks on Iran's nuclear sites,"" Baghaei asserted.

Grossi warns of potential uranium enrichment resumption

Rafael Grossi, the IAEA Director General, warned on Sunday that Iran could resume uranium enrichment within months, despite claims by Washington that recent air strikes had significantly degraded Tehran’s nuclear capabilities.

""The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that,"" Grossi said in an interview with CBS News’ Face the Nation.

He acknowledged the physical damage to key facilities in Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan but stressed that the scientific and technical expertise within Iran remains intact.

“You cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have,” Grossi noted.

He also expressed concern over reports that Iran may have relocated its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in the days leading up to the strikes.

""It is not clear where that material was,"" Grossi said.

IAEA inspectors remained in Tehran even during the conflict, which included intense Israeli bombings."

Republicans eyeing the 2026 midterm congressional elections are divided over the package, which would strip health care from millions of the poorest Americans and add more than $3 trillion to the country's debt.

The Senate formally opened debate on the bill after Republican holdouts delayed what should have been a procedural vote, drawing Trump's ire on social media.

Senators narrowly passed the motion to begin debate, 51-49, hours after the vote was first called, with Vice President JD Vance joining negotiations with holdouts from his own party.

Ultimately, two Republican senators joined 47 Democrats in voting ""nay"" on opening debate.

Trump has pushed his party to get the bill passed and on his desk for him to sign into law by July 4, the United States' Independence Day.

Democrats are bitterly opposed to the legislation and Trump's agenda and have vowed to hold up the debate.

They began by insisting that the entirety of the bill be read aloud to the chamber before the debate commences.

The bill is roughly 1,000 pages long and will take an estimated 15 hours to read.

""Republicans won't tell America what's in the bill,"" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.

""So Democrats are forcing it to be read start to finish on the floor. We will be here all night if that's what it takes to read it.""

If passed in the Senate, the bill would go back to the House for approval, where Republicans can only afford to lose a handful of votes and are facing stiff opposition from within their own ranks.

Republicans are scrambling to offset the $4.5 trillion cost of Trump's tax relief, with many of the proposed cuts to come from decimating funding for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans.

Republicans are split on the Medicaid cuts, which will threaten scores of rural hospitals and lead to an estimated 8.6 million Americans being deprived of health care.

The spending plan would also roll back many of the tax incentives for renewable energy that were put in place under Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden.

On Saturday, key Trump ally Elon Musk, with whom the president had a public falling out this month over his criticism of the bill, called the current proposal ""utterly insane and destructive"".

""It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,"" said Musk, who is the world's richest person and owns electric vehicle company Tesla and space flight firm SpaceX, among others.

Independent analysis also shows that the bill would pave the way for a historic redistribution of wealth from the poorest 10 per cent of Americans to the richest.

The bill is unpopular across multiple demographic, age and income groups, according to extensive recent polling.

Although the House has already passed its own version, both chambers have to agree on the same text before it can be signed into law."

“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country,” Musk wrote on X on Saturday as the Senate was scheduled to call a vote to open debate on the nearly 1,000-page bill. “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, whose birthday is also Saturday, later posted that the bill would be “political suicide for the Republican Party”.

The criticisms reopen a recent fiery conflict between the former head of the Department of Government Efficiency and the administration he recently left.

They also represent yet another headache for Republican Senate leaders who have spent the weekend working overtime to get the legislation through their chamber so it can pass by Trump's Fourth of July deadline.

Musk has previously made his opinions about Trump's “big, beautiful bill” clear. Days after he left the federal government last month with a laudatory celebration in the Oval Office, he blasted the bill as “pork-filled” and a “disgusting abomination”.

“Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,” he wrote on X earlier this month. In another post, the wealthy GOP donor who had recently forecasted that he’d step back from political donations threatened to fire lawmakers who “betrayed the American people”.

When Trump clapped back to say he was disappointed with Musk, back-and-forth fighting erupted and quickly escalated. Musk suggested without evidence that Trump, who spent the first part of the year as one of his closest allies, was mentioned in files related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein.

Musk ultimately tried to make nice with the administration, saying he regretted some of his posts that “went too far”. Trump responded in kind in an interview with The New York Post, saying, “Things like that happen. I don't blame him for anything.”

It’s unclear how Musk’s latest broadsides will influence the fragile peace he and the president had enjoyed in recent weeks. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Musk has spent recent weeks focused on his businesses, and his political influence has waned since he left the administration.

Still, the wealthy businessman poured hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump’s campaign in 2024, demonstrating the impact his money can have if he’s passionate enough about an issue or candidate to restart his political spending."

Police deployed scores of officers around government buildings, parliament and nearby Pionirski Park, where throngs of Vucic's backers from across the country gathered in a counter-protest.

After the protest ended at around 10 p.m. (2000 GMT) some protesters who wanted to confront Vucic's backers threw flares at police, while the police used pepper spray to disperse them.

Months of protests across the country, including university shutdowns, have been ongoing against Vucic’s rule, whose second term ends in 2027, when there are also parliamentary elections scheduled.

Vucic's opponents accuse him and his allies of ties to organised crime, violence against rivals and curbing media freedoms, something they deny.

The student protest was set to last until 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) at Slavija Square and Nemanjina Avenue, where most of the government offices are located.

Vucic has previously refused snap elections. His Progressive Party-led coalition holds 156 of 250 parliamentary seats.

On Saturday, Vucic said unspecified ""foreign powers"" were behind the protest. He said police should be restrained, but warned that violence will not be tolerated.

In the days ahead of the protest, police arrested about a dozen anti-government activists, charging them with undermining the constitution and terrorism. All denied the charges.

An executive order that the Republican president signed on his first day back in office in January would restrict birthright citizenship – a far-reaching plan that three federal judges, questioning its constitutionality, quickly halted nationwide through so-called ""universal"" injunctions.

But the Supreme Court's ruling on Friday, while announcing a dramatic shift in how judges have operated for years, deploying such relief, left enough room for the challengers to Trump's directive to try to prevent it from taking effect while litigation over its legality plays out.

""I do not expect the president's executive order on birthright citizenship will ever go into effect,"" said Samuel Bray, a Notre Dame Law School professor and a prominent critic of universal injunctions whose work the court's majority cited extensively in Friday's ruling.

Trump's executive order directs federal agencies to refuse to recognise the citizenship of children born in the United States who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or a lawful permanent resident, also called a ""green card"" holder.

The three judges found that the order likely violates the citizenship language in the US Constitution's 14th Amendment.

The directive remains blocked while lower courts reconsider the scope of their injunctions, and the Supreme Court said it cannot take effect for 30 days, a window that gives the challengers time to seek further protection from those courts.

The court's six conservative justices delivered the majority ruling, granting Trump's request to narrow the injunctions issued by the judges in Maryland, Washington and Massachusetts.

Its three liberal members dissented.

The ruling by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, whom Trump appointed to the court in 2020, emphasised the need to hem in the power of judges, warning against an ""imperial"" judiciary. Judges can provide ""complete relief"" only to the plaintiffs before them, Barrett wrote.

A host of policies

That outcome was a major victory for Trump and his allies, who have repeatedly denounced judges who have impeded his agenda.

It could make it easier for the administration to implement its policies, including accelerating deportations of migrants, curtailing diversity and inclusion efforts, and downsizing the federal government, many of which have tested the limits of executive power.

In the birthright citizenship dispute, the ruling left open the potential for individual plaintiffs to seek relief beyond themselves through class action lawsuits targeting a policy that would upend the long-held understanding that the Constitution confers citizenship on virtually anyone born on US soil.

Bray said he expects a surge of new class action cases, resulting in ""class-protective"" injunctions.

""Given that the birthright-citizenship executive order is unconstitutional, I expect courts will grant those preliminary injunctions, and they will be affirmed on appeal,"" Bray said.

Legal experts said they expect a lot of legal manoeuvring in lower courts in the weeks ahead, and the challengers still face an uphill battle.

Compared to injunctions in individual cases, class actions are often harder to successfully mount. States, too, still do not know whether they have the requisite legal entitlement to sue. Trump's administration said they do not, but the court left that debate unresolved.

Meanwhile, the 30-day clock is ticking. If the challengers are unsuccessful going forward, Trump's order could apply in some parts of the country but not others.

""The ruling is set to go into effect 30 days from now and leaves families in states across the country in deep uncertainty about whether their children will be born as US citizens,"" said Elora Mukherjee, director of Columbia Law School's immigrants' rights clinic."

Immigrant advocates are vowing to fight to ensure birthright citizenship remains the law as the Republican president tries to do away with more than a century of precedent.

The top court's ruling sends cases challenging the president's birthright citizenship executive order back to the lower courts.

But the ultimate fate of the president's policy remains uncertain.

Here's what to know about birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court's ruling and what happens next.

What does birthright citizenship mean?

Birthright citizenship makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers in the country illegally.

The practice goes back to soon after the Civil War, when Congress ratified the Constitution's 14th Amendment.

""All persons born or naturalised in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States,"" the amendment states.

Thirty years later, Wong Kim Ark, a man born in the US to Chinese parents, was refused re-entry into the US after traveling overseas. His suit led to the Supreme Court explicitly ruling that the amendment gives citizenship to anyone born in the US, no matter their parents' legal status.

It has been seen since then as an intrinsic part of US law, with only a handful of exceptions, such as for children born in the US to foreign diplomats.

Trump's executive order, signed in January seeks to deny citizenship to children who are born to people who are living in the US illegally or temporarily. It's part of the hardline immigration agenda of the president, who has called birthright citizenship a ""magnet for illegal immigration.""

Trump and his supporters focus on one phrase in the amendment — ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" – saying it means the US can deny citizenship to babies born to women in the country illegally.

A series of federal judges have said that’s not true and issued nationwide injunctions stopping his order from taking effect.

""I've been on the bench for over four decades. I can’t remember another case where the question presented was as clear as this one is. This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,"" US District Judge John Coughenour said at a hearing earlier this year in his Seattle courtroom.

In Greenbelt, Maryland, a Washington suburb, US District Judge Deborah Boardman wrote that ""the Supreme Court has resoundingly rejected and no court in the country has ever endorsed"" Trump's interpretation of birthright citizenship.

Is Trump's order constitutional? The justices didn't say.

The apex court's ruling was a major victory for the Trump administration in that it limited an individual judge's authority in granting nationwide injunctions. The administration hailed the ruling as a monumental check on the powers of individual district court judges, whom Trump supporters have argued want to usurp the president's authority with rulings blocking his priorities around immigration and other matters.

But the Supreme Court did not address the merits of Trump's bid to enforce his birthright citizenship executive order.

""The Trump administration made a strategic decision, which I think quite clearly paid off, that they were going to challenge not the judges' decisions on the merits, but on the scope of relief,"" said Jessica Levinson, a Loyola Law School professor.

Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters at the White House that the administration is ""very confident"" that the Supreme Court will ultimately side with the administration on the merits of the case.

Uncertainty swirls around next steps The justices kicked the cases challenging the birthright citizenship policy back down to the lower courts, where judges will have to decide how to tailor their orders to comply with the new ruling. The executive order remains blocked for at least 30 days, giving lower courts and the parties time to sort out the next steps.

The Supreme Court's ruling leaves open the possibility that groups challenging the policy could still get nationwide relief through class-action lawsuits and seek certification as a nationwide class. Within hours after the ruling, two class-action suits had been filed in Maryland and New Hampshire seeking to block Trump's order.

But obtaining nationwide relief through a class action is difficult as courts have put up hurdles to doing so over the years, said Suzette Malveaux, a Washington and Lee University law school professor.

""It’s not the case that a class action is a sort of easy, breezy way of getting around this problem of not having nationwide relief,” said Malveaux, who had urged the top court not to eliminate the nationwide injunctions.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who penned the court's dissenting opinion, urged the lower courts to ""act swiftly on such requests for relief and to adjudicate the cases as quickly as they can so as to enable this Court’s prompt review"" in cases ""challenging policies as blatantly unlawful and harmful as the Citizenship Order.""

Opponents of Trump's order warned there would be a patchwork of polices across the states, leading to chaos and confusion without nationwide relief.

""Birthright citizenship has been settled constitutional law for more than a century,"" said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, a nonprofit that supports refugees and migrants. ""By denying lower courts the ability to enforce that right uniformly, the Court has invited chaos, inequality, and fear."""

""The Great and Powerful Iranian People, who showed the world that the Israeli regime had NO CHOICE but to RUN to 'Daddy' to avoid being flattened by our Missiles, do not take kindly to Threats and Insults,"" the foreign minister said.

The United States carried out attacks on three Iranian nuclear sites last weekend, with no consensus as to how effective they were.

With those strikes, Washington joined Israel's aggression against Iran in the 12-day conflict launched on June 13.

The Foreign Minister's condemnation on Saturday came after Trump said on his Truth Social platform that he had saved the Iranian leader from assassination, accusing Khamenei of ingratitude.

""I knew EXACTLY where he was sheltered, and would not let Israel, or the US Armed Forces, by far the Greatest and Most Powerful in the World, terminate his life,"" Trump posted.

""I SAVED HIM FROM A VERY UGLY AND IGNOMINIOUS DEATH, and he does not have to say, 'THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP!'""

""But no, instead I get hit with a statement of anger, hatred, and disgust, and immediately dropped all work on sanction relief, and more,"" Trump added, exhorting Iran to return to the negotiating table.

Friday's resolution, introduced by Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, sought to reaffirm that Trump must seek authorisation from Congress before initiating new military attacks on Iran.

But it fell short in the Republican-controlled chamber, marking Congress' first serious attempt to reassert its constitutional role in decisions of war since the strikes.

Asked whether he would order more bombings of Iranian nuclear facilities if necessary, Trump replied bluntly: ""Sure, without question.""

Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate and have largely backed the president's approach, arguing Iran posed an imminent threat that justified swift action.

""Of course, we can debate the scope and strategy of our military engagements,"" said Republican Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee.

""But we must not shackle our president in the middle of a crisis when lives are on the line.""

Democrats challenged that view, saying Trump bypassed Congress and failed to properly brief lawmakers until days after the attack.

""This is about making sure we don't go to war without a political consensus,"" Kaine said.

""If it's defence, act quickly. But if it's offence, let's really make sure we're making the right decision.""

The measure would not have limited the president’s authority to respond to a direct threat, but it would have required congressional debate before launching offensive strikes.

Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky broke with his party, backing the resolution and calling on others to do the same.

Trump.. the decision maker

Trump, like many presidents before him, has pushed the limits of the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which requires the president to consult Congress ""in every possible instance"" before deploying US armed forces.

In a letter to Congress this week, Trump described the Iran strikes as ""limited in scope and purpose"" and aimed at deterring future attacks.

But after classified briefings with top White House officials, some lawmakers remained unconvinced.

""There was no imminent threat to the United States,"" said Representative Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.

""There’s always an Iranian threat to the world. But this wasn’t materially different from two weeks earlier.""

Despite such doubts, most Republicans stood firmly behind Trump’s decision.

Many said backing the resolution now would amount to undermining the president during sensitive negotiations and at a time when they are working to advance his legislative agenda.

Trump has since said that a ceasefire between the US and Iran is now in place, but tensions remain high.

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Washington against launching future attacks, while US officials say they expect diplomatic talks with Tehran to resume soon."

There were at least 127 violent hate-related reports mentioning Mamdani or his campaign in the day after polls closed, said CAIR Action, an arm of the Council on American Islamic Relations advocacy group, which logs such incidents.

That marks a five-fold increase over a daily average of such reports tracked earlier this month, CAIR Action said in a statement.

Overall, it noted about 6,200 online posts that mentioned some form of Islamophobic slur or hostility in that day long time-frame.

Mamdani, a democratic socialist and a 33-year-old state lawmaker, declared victory in Tuesday's primary after former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded defeat.

Born in Uganda to Indian parents, Mamdani would be the city's first Muslim and South Asian mayor if he wins the November general election.

""We call on public officials of every party - including those whose allies are amplifying these smears - to unequivocally condemn Islamophobia,"" said Basim Elkarra, executive director of CAIR Action.

The advocacy group said its hate monitoring system includes its own scraping and analysis of posts, online submissions by the public and notifications from law enforcement. About 62 percent of the anti-Muslim posts against Mamdani originated on X, CAIR Action said.

On Wednesday, Republican US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene posted an AI-generated picture of the Statue of Liberty draped in a burqa.

Ali A Olomi, a historian of the Middle East and Islam, reacting to Greene's post said the original design for the Statue of Liberty was ""a Muslim woman, an Egyptian peasant.""

""Bartholdi designed it as a gift to Egypt. It gradually evolved into a classic colossus known as 'Liberty Enlightening the World' and gifted to the US,"" Olomi wrote on X.

The White House, which did not respond to a request for comment, has denied claims of discrimination against Muslims.

Trump and his allies have said they oppose Mamdani and others due to what they call the Democrats' ""radical left"" ideology.

The New York City Police Department said earlier this month its hate crime unit was probing anti-Muslim threats against Mamdani.

Manjusha Kulkarni, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, which documents hate against Asian Americans, and CAIR said attacks against Mamdani mirrored those endured by other South Asian and Muslim political figures, including former Vice President Kamala Harris and Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib.

Republicans have called Mamdani anti-Semitic, citing his pro-Palestine advocacy and his criticism of Israel's genocide in Gaza.

Mamdani has condemned antisemitism and has the backing of New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who is Jewish. Lander also ran in the Democratic primary.

Rights advocates have noted rising antisemitism and Islamophobia since the start of the Israel’s war on Gaza, with fatal US incidents including the shooting of two Israeli embassy staff in Washington and the stabbing of a Muslim child in Illinois.

Mamdani and other pro-Palestine advocates, including some Jewish groups, said their criticism of Israel is wrongly conflated with anti-Semitism."

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on Friday that it is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, claiming conditions in their homeland have improved enough to warrant their return.

The program is set to expire on August 3, with termination taking effect on September 2.

TPS allows individuals from countries facing armed conflict or environmental disaster to live and work legally in the US.

Haitians have benefited from the status since a devastating earthquake struck the country in 2010.

This move affects around 500,000 people—many of whom have lived in the US for more than a decade—who could now be forced to return to a country still gripped by crisis.

A DHS spokesperson defended the decision, saying it ""restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that Temporary Protected Status is actually temporary."" The department also advised Haitians to use a mobile app called CBP Home to prepare for departure.

But critics say the decision ignores dire conditions on the ground.

The US State Department’s travel advisory for Haiti remains unchanged, still urging Americans not to travel there due to widespread violence, kidnappings and lack of medical infrastructure.

The move follows the administration’s broader efforts to limit immigration, including revoking humanitarian parole programmes and scaling back TPS protections for other nationalities such as Venezuelans and Afghans.

""You see your friends who went to work every day suddenly unable to leave home—not because they’re sick or fired, but because of a decision like this,"" he said.

""Even if it hasn’t happened to you yet, you start thinking, 'What if I’m next?'""

Desir lives in Springfield, Ohio, with his wife and two children, and works at a car parts factory.

His asylum court date was recently pushed to 2028.

Some TPS holders have applied for asylum or other legal status, but it remains unclear how many will ultimately be left without protection.

Meanwhile, the US Supreme Court has removed a key legal barrier to a Trump administration order aimed at restricting birthright citizenship.

In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled that lower courts do not have the authority to issue nationwide injunctions blocking the executive order.

The order, signed on the first day of Trump’s second term, seeks to deny automatic US citizenship to children born on American soil to non-citizens holding short-term visas or without legal status.

While the court didn’t rule on the legality of the order itself, the three liberal justices dissented, arguing it violates US law.

The decision covers three related lawsuits, all of which were initially blocked by lower courts before being overturned on appeal."

The so-called ""Supplemental Award of Competence"" comes amid a long-standing disagreement over India's Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in India-administered Kashmir — developments Pakistan says violate the 1960 treaty brokered by the World Bank.

The court's unanimous decision stated that ""it was not open to India to take unilateral action to suspend these proceedings.""

It found that the treaty continues in force unless both sides agree to terminate it.

""According to its terms, the Treaty continues in force until terminated with the mutual consent of India and Pakistan,"" the court said.

""The Treaty's compulsory third-party dispute settlement process cannot be unilaterally suspended or held in abeyance, as doing so would undermine its efficacy.""

India had paused engagement with the treaty in April, citing a deadly attack in India-administered Kashmir that left 26 people dead.

New Delhi argued that the circumstances warranted a halt to cooperation.

But Pakistan welcomed the ruling, saying it confirms that India cannot strip the arbitration court or a neutral expert of their ability to decide such disputes.

""The high priority, at this point, is that India and Pakistan find a way back to a meaningful dialogue, including on the application of the IWT,"" Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said.

India rejected the ruling outright, accusing the tribunal of overstepping its mandate.

""India has never recognised the existence of this so-called Court of Arbitration,"" New Delhi said, describing its formation as ""a brazen violation"" of the treaty.

It also reiterated that any decision by the court is ""illegal and per se void.""

The Indus Waters Treaty, brokered by the World Bank and signed in 1960, allocates control over six rivers between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.

The three eastern rivers — Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej — went to India for mostly unrestricted use.

The three western rivers — Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab — were allocated to Pakistan, even though India received the right to use their waters in limited quantities for non-consumptive purposes like hydropower generation.

Kashmir remains a long-standing flashpoint, contested by two nuclear powers since the British vacated the sub-continent.

Since 1989, rebel groups have fought some half a million Indian troops for the territory to become independent or unite with Pakistan, a goal most of the region's Muslim majority population support.

India blames Pakistan for backing what it calls ""terrorism"", a charge Islamabad denies.

Pakistan states that it only supports the demand of Kashmiris for a UN-sponsored plebiscite in the region ""politically, morally and diplomatically."""

""Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday.

He called the country ""very difficult"" to trade with.

Trump was referring to Canada's digital services tax, which was enacted last year and forecast to bring in Can$5.9 billion (US$4.2 billion) over five years.

While the measure is not new, US service providers will be ""on the hook for a multi-billion dollar payment in Canada"" come June 30, noted the Computer & Communications Industry Association recently.

The three percent tax applies to large or multinational companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta that provide digital services to Canadians, and Washington has previously requested dispute settlement talks over the matter.

Canada may have been spared some of Trump's most sweeping duties, such as a 10 percent levy on nearly all US trading partners, but it faces a separate tariff regime.

Trump has also imposed steep levies on imports of steel, aluminum and autos.

Last week, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Ottawa will adjust its 25 percent counter tariffs on US steel and aluminum — in response to a doubling of US levies on the metals to 50 percent — if a bilateral trade deal was not reached in 30 days.

""We will continue to conduct these complex negotiations in the best interest of Canadians,"" Carney said on Friday, adding that he had not spoken to Trump following the US president's announcement.

Trump's latest salvo targeting Canada came shortly after Washington and Beijing confirmed finalising a framework to move forward on trade.

Beijing said Washington would lift ""restrictive measures"" while China would ""review and approve"" items under export controls.

A priority for Washington in talks with Beijing had been ensuring the supply of the rare earths essential for products including electric vehicles, hard drives, and national defense equipment.

China, which dominates global production of the elements, began requiring export licenses in early April, a move widely viewed as a response to Trump's blistering tariffs.

The two sides agreed after talks in Geneva in May to temporarily lower steep tit-for-tat duties on each other's products.

China also committed to easing some non-tariff countermeasures, but US officials later accused Beijing of violating the pact and slow-walking export license approvals for rare earths.

They eventually agreed on a framework to move forward with their Geneva consensus following talks in London this month.

A White House official said that the Trump administration and China had ""agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement.""

This clarification came after the US president told an event that Washington had inked a deal relating to trade with China, without providing details.

Under the deal, China ""will review and approve applications for the export control items that meet the requirements in accordance with the law,"" China's commerce ministry said.

""The US side will correspondingly cancel a series of restrictive measures against China,"" it added.

Dozens of economies, although not China, face a July 9 deadline for steeper duties to kick in, rising from a current 10 percent.

It remains to be seen if other countries facing the higher US tariffs will successfully reach agreements to avoid them before the deadline.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Friday that Washington could wrap up its agenda for trade deals by September, indicating more agreements could be concluded although talks were likely to extend past July.

Bessent reiterated that there are 18 key partners Washington is focused on pacts with.

""If we can ink 10 or 12 of the important 18, there are another important 20 relationships, then I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labour Day,"" Bessent said, referring to the US holiday on September 1.

The White House has already suggested that the July deadline could be extended, or Trump could pick a tariff rate for countries if there is no agreement.

Wall Street's major indexes, which bounced early Friday on hopes for deals, lost some ground after Trump called off Canada talks."

Trump, at an Oval Office event celebrating a DRC-Rwanda peace accord on Friday, told reporters that he believes a ceasefire is close.

He said he had been just been talking to some of the people involved in trying to reach a ceasefire to hostilities between Israel and Hamas.

""We think even next week, we're going to get a ceasefire,"" Trump said.

Trump's remarks came after the Israeli daily Haaretz reported that nearly 100,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's genocide in Gaza, representing about 4 percent of the territory's population.

Palestinians have documented over 56,300 fatalities, mostly women and minors.

Some 11,000 Palestinians feared buried under rubble of annihilated homes, according to Palestine's official WAFA news agency.

Experts, however, contend that the actual death toll significantly exceeds what the Gaza authorities have reported, estimating it could be around 200,000.

Israel is said to have abducted some 11,000 Palestinians from Gaza and occupied West Bank since October 2023.

Study on Gaza fatalities

Haaretz said in addition to the high Palestinian deaths from Israeli attacks, many people also died from the indirect effects of the war such as hunger, cold and diseases amid a collapse of the health system in Gaza.

The daily said while Israeli spokespersons, journalists and influencers reject with knee-jerk disgust the death toll announced by Gaza's Health Ministry as exaggerated, more and more international experts ""are stating that not only is this list, with all the horror it embodies, reliable – but that it may even be very conservative in relation to reality.""

It cited a study conducted by Professor Michael Spagat, an economist at Holloway College at the University of London, a world-class expert on mortality in violent conflicts, about deaths in Gaza.

The study surveyed 2,000 households in the Palestinian enclave, comprising almost 10,000 people.

""They concluded that, as of January 2025, some 75,200 people died a violent death in Gaza during the war, the vast majority caused by Israeli munitions,"" it said."

Speaking live on a local media, A Haber on Friday, Fidan said many EU countries initially resisted ceasefire efforts that didn’t serve Israel’s interests, but are now rethinking their positions.

“Europe didn’t want a ceasefire that went against Israel, but they’ve come to see the situation is no longer sustainable,” he said.

Commenting on tensions between Israel and Iran, Fidan said Israel’s attack prompted Iran to respond within its legitimate right to self-defence. He accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of fueling regional instability for personal political gain.

“Netanyahu is willing to set the whole region ablaze to stay in power,” Fidan said.

He added that Israel’s recent moves revealed its inability to dismantle Iran’s nuclear programme on its own.

Fidan also highlighted Türkiye’s efforts to mediate in the Iran-Israel conflict. President Erdogan has reached out to both sides, offering to play a constructive role in reducing tensions, he said.

He noted that diplomacy in Oman may restart soon, potentially leading to dialogue between the US and Iran.

“Türkiye has put forward proposals to help bridge the divide. The main issue remains: the US wants zero enrichment, while Iran insists on its right to peaceful nuclear energy,” he said."

The plot was also revealed barely a few days after Pashinyan visited Türkiye as part of his efforts to seek better ties with Ankara.Authorities in the Caucasus nation of nearly three million people arrested Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan on Wednesday. He is the leader of the nationalist opposition movement Holy Struggle, which opposes Azerbaijan’s sovereignty over the Karabakh region. Galstanyan is also a leading member of the Armenian Apostolic Church, the country’s most powerful religious establishment.

Tensions between the Church, its allies and Pashinyan have escalated since Armenia’s 2020 defeat to Baku in the Karabakh region, which returned fully to Azerbaijani control after a 23-hour offensive in 2023.

While Pashinyan seeks a peace treaty with Azerbaijan and normalisation with Türkiye, an ally of Baku, the Church’s top religious leader Catholicos Garegin II, and allies like Galstanyan oppose de-escalation with Armenia’s two Turkic neighbours. Rather, they blame Pashinyan for Yerevan’s defeats and have repeatedly called for his resignation.

The Church leadership, which has connections with Armenian diaspora and radical groups like Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun), has sought to oust the government, says Kamer Kasim, a professor of international relations at Abant Izzet Baysal University.

“It appears that those anti-Pashinyan political groups backed by the Church orchestrated this coup attempt. Some former military and police officers apparently participated in the coup attempt,” Kasim tells TRT World.

Armenia arrests Archbishop Bagrat Galstanyan over alleged coup plot.

“They (anti-Pashinyan forces) are desperate and they will try to do everything to stop the peace treaty with Azerbaijan and normalisation with Türkiye,” says Fuad Chiragov, a Baku-based political analyst. He adds that the Church-allied forces might even resort to violent tactics to overthrow Pashinyan.

Former Armenian President Robert Kocharyan, a leading opposition figure, has long opposed reopening the Armenia-Türkiye border, fearing it would turn Yerevan into Adjara, the Georgian region where Turkish trade and investment account for around 80-90 percent of foreign capital, creating significantly more wealth compared to other parts of Georgia.

Most recently, Pashinyan visited Ankara, holding a critical meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, discussing possibilities of “the Armenia–Türkiye normalisation process, regional developments, and the importance of sustained dialogue.”

Pashinyan understands that without Turkish support, Armenia cannot prosper across Caucasia, says Zakhid Farrukh Mamedov, professor of international economics at Azerbaijan State University of Economics in Baku. But Pashinyan’s move has angered opposition groups, who fear losing their relevance in Armenian society, Mamedov adds.

As Kocharyan feared, opening borders with Ankara will potentially “transform Armenia into Adjara, pulling much investment from both Türkiye and Azerbaijan,” Chiragov tells TRT World.

The prospect of this prosperity makes the anti-peace camp “afraid” of any kind of normalisation with Azerbaijan and Türkiye because that would damage their political agenda and essentially “marginalise” them, according to Chiragov.

“Evil, listen carefully – whatever you do, you have very little time left. Hold on, we are coming,” Galstanyan said, referring to Pashinyan, according to the AFP news agency.

Chiragov says the coup attempt was” triggered” by the twin normalisation processes with Armenia and Türkiye and Yerevan and Baku. Opposition groups have expressly opposed opening borders with these neighbours.

He also points to Armenia’s upcoming constitutional referendum next year, as another motivation for the coup attempt. The referendum aims to amend constitutional clauses claiming Karabakh as Armenian territory.

If approved, this would remove a key legal obstacle to a peace treaty with Azerbaijan, a prospect that makes anti-peace forces nervous, says Chiragov.

Armenian PM Pashinyan visited Ankara, holding a critical meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

“Many of Prime Minister Pashinyan’s political opponents have long opposed peace with Azerbaijan, dubbing him a ‘traitor’ for doing so,” says Matthew Bryza, a former US ambassador to Azerbaijan.

“There were also rumours of a potential assassination plot against Pashinyan in early 2021, but he and his political movement subsequently won the June 2021 elections, underscoring that the large majority of Armenians do seek peace with Azerbaijan,” Bryza tells TRT World.

Chiragov sees the country as evenly split. Armenian society is sharply divided between Pashinyan’s pro-peace supporters and Church-led anti-peace groups backed through funding, media campaigns and lobbying by some diaspora groups, he says. “Much depends on how smart Pashinyan will act.”

Galstanyan, the detained opposition leader, is a Canadian-Armenian, while another alleged coup plotter, Samvel Karapetyan, is a Russian-Armenian businessman. Russia, home to the largest Armenian diaspora, has denied any involvement, calling it an “internal matter”.

However, Karapetyan’s remarks during a recent interview suggest otherwise: “If Armenia’s political forces fail to resolve this situation, we will have to intervene in our own way in the campaign against the Church.”

Mamedov finds these comments troubling: “Russia says Karapetyan is its citizen, but why does a Russian citizen with Armenian roots make such a statement in regard to the Armenian church’s position against Pashinyan?”

Some Russian citizens with Armenian roots like Karapetyan find themselves suitable to intervene in Yerevan's internal politics, says Mamedov. “But this mentality is unacceptable,” he tells TRT World.

“This is a very historical moment for Armenia, which now faces a dilemma. If Pashinyan wins, it means that pro-peace and pro-regional integration forces overcome anti-peace forces, signalling Azerbaijan and Türkiye that Armenia is changing its long-held position against them,” Chiragov adds.

Because of this internal divide, Baku has not yet signed a peace treaty with Yerevan. “We want to see which side will eventually win the hearts and minds of people. Azerbaijan is aware of the fact that if the anti-peace opposition wins against Pashinyan, they will annul everything, including a peace treaty with Baku,” warns Chiragov.

Azerbaijan is closely watching the upcoming referendum. If it passes, he says, it will definitely pave the way for an Azerbaijan-Armenia peace treaty."

Speaking at a news conference on Friday in Minsk, Belarus, Putin said the date of the third round of the Russian-Ukrainian talks in Istanbul will be determined after completing the war prisoner exchanges, negotiated in Türkiye on June 2.

""In general, we are ready for this (next round of talks), we need to coordinate the place and time. I hope that the president of the Republic of Türkiye, Mr (Recep Tayyip) Erdogan, remains in his position to support this process, and we are very grateful to him for this,"" he said.

The dates of the next Russian-Ukrainian meeting will be defined by the head of the negotiation teams, he added.

""We are ready to hold such a meeting in Istanbul. But when specifically, these are the group leaders from both sides, and they are in constant contact, they are now agreeing on the time of the meeting,"" he said.

Putin added that in his opinion, the teams should discuss memoranda on a peace treaty.

Istanbul previously hosted a series of talks in March 2022 – just after the conflict began – aimed at finding common ground to end the armed conflict, but failed to reach a settlement to the war, which is now in its fourth year.

On May 16, Russia and Ukraine held their first direct talks in three years again in the Turkish metropolis.

After two rounds of negotiations in May and June, Russia and Ukraine agreed to exchange more prisoners of war — focusing on the youngest and most severely wounded — and return the bodies of 12,000 soldiers that have been killed in the armed conflict.

Turkish President, a longtime champion of resolving the conflict, has repeatedly offered for Türkiye to host peace talks and do whatever it can to promote a resolution.

Attorney Poghosyan said law enforcement agents inquired about Ajapakhyan, head of the Shirak Diocese of the AAC, who was scheduled to attend a meeting later in the day.

Earlier, criminal proceedings were initiated against Ajapakhyan on charges of public calls for the usurpation of power, violation of territorial integrity, renunciation of sovereignty, or violent overthrow of constitutional order. The maximum penalty for this offence is five-year imprisonment.

Church leader Garigin II has called for Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan’s resignation since Armenia lost a war to Azerbaijan in 2020.

Last year, mass protests led by Bagrat Galstanyan, an archbishop and leader of the opposition movement Holy Struggle, had also called on Pashinyan to resign over the country’s defeat against Azerbaijan. He was detained on Wednesday along with many others."

But questions remain over the deal's ambiguity and the political and economic interests behind it.

The agreement comes after months of diplomacy led by the Trump administration, which has publicly celebrated the initiative.

US President Donald Trump has also voiced frustration over not being awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his involvement.

However, critics warn that the deal lacks clarity, particularly around its economic framework.

The eastern DRC is rich in minerals such as cobalt and lithium — vital for electric vehicles — and the US is eager to counter China's growing influence in the region.

The M23 rebel group, made up largely of ethnic Tutsis, renewed its offensives in late 2021, capturing large swathes of territory including Goma, a key city near the Rwandan border.

Kinshasa has repeatedly accused Kigali of backing M23 — an allegation Washington supports.

Rwanda denies this, insisting instead on action against the FDLR — a group made up of ethnic Hutus, including figures linked to the 1994 genocide.

The deal will be signed by Foreign Ministers Olivier Nduhungirehe of Rwanda and Therese Kayikwamba Wagner of the DRC in the presence of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, according to State Department deputy spokesman Tommy Pigott.

The White House says Trump will also meet both ministers at the Oval Office.

In a joint statement, the three countries said the deal includes a pledge to respect territorial integrity, ban hostilities, and disarm all non-state armed groups.

It also refers to a ""regional economic integration framework"" and a planned summit involving Trump, Rwandan President Paul Kagame and DRC President Felix Tshisekedi.

The agreement was mediated with help from Qatar and Massad Boulos, a Lebanese-American businessman who is Trump's senior adviser on Africa and the father-in-law of his daughter Tiffany.

Controversy over economic angle

Denis Mukwege, the Congolese doctor who shared the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end wartime sexual violence, criticised the deal for rewarding aggression.

In a statement, he said the agreement ""would amount to granting a reward for aggression, legitimising the plundering of Congolese natural resources, and forcing the victim to alienate their national heritage by sacrificing justice in order to ensure a precarious and fragile peace.""

Ahead of the signing, Africa Intelligence reported the deal requires Rwanda to pull back its ""defensive measures"" and for the DRC to cut ties with the FDLR.

But Rwanda’s foreign minister denied the report, saying: ""The words 'Rwanda Defence Force', 'Rwandan troops' or 'withdrawal' are nowhere to be seen in the document.""

The DRC’s top diplomat had said during her April visit to Washington that Kigali must withdraw from Congolese territory.

Both nations are working to maintain favour with Washington.

Rwanda has discussed hosting migrants deported from the US — a major policy priority for Trump.

Meanwhile, Kinshasa is proposing a US investment agreement modeled after a minerals deal Washington once pursued with Ukraine."

The reactions followed a classified briefing on the operation, which was ordered by US President Donald Trump.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticised what he described as a lack of coherent planning, saying he received no satisfactory answer when he asked about Trump's assertion that Iran's nuclear programme had been ""obliterated.""

""There was no coherent strategy, no end game, no plan,"" Schumer told reporters, calling for enforcement of the War Powers Act, a measure intended to limit a president's ability to wage military campaigns without congressional approval.

Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said the briefing confirmed his view that the air strikes merely delayed Iran’s programme by ""a handful of months.""

He dismissed Trump's language as inflated, adding: ""You cannot bomb knowledge out of existence, no matter how many scientists you kill.""

Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas said the strikes inflicted ""catastrophic damage"" by targeting key components such as centrifuges, conversion facilities and nuclear scientists.

""We're confident because these are all single points of failure in Iran's nuclear weapons effort,"" Cotton said.

Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina agreed the strikes had been effective but warned the problem had not disappeared.

""I don't want people to think the problem is over, because it’s not,"" he said.

""They're going to keep trying this.""

Lingering debate over strike's effectiveness

The classified briefing did little to settle the debate over whether the strikes truly damaged Iran’s nuclear capabilities or merely caused a temporary setback.

Questions continue to mount over the strategic outcome and timing of the operation.

A European intelligence report released around the same time concluded that while the strikes inflicted damage, they stopped short of destroying Iran’s nuclear facilities entirely.

The report stated that most of the impacted infrastructure could eventually be repaired.

Trump has lashed out at US media outlets such as CNN and The New York Times over their reporting, which suggested the strikes failed to end Iran’s nuclear ambitions.

Khamenei says Trump exaggerated events

Meanwhile, in a televised speech — his first appearance since a ceasefire in the war with Israel — Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei hailed what he described as Iran's ""victory"" over Israel, vowed never to yield to US pressure and insisted Washington had been dealt a humiliating ""slap"".

""The American president exaggerated events in unusual ways, and it turned out that he needed this exaggeration,"" Khamenei said, rejecting US claims Iran's nuclear programme had been set back by decades.

The strikes, he insisted, had done ""nothing significant"" to Iran's nuclear infrastructure.

But Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the damage ""serious"" and said a detailed assessment was under way.

The Israeli military said Iran's nuclear sites had taken a ""significant"" blow, but cautioned it was ""still early"" to fully assess the damage.

Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had ""thwarted Iran's nuclear project"", warning any attempt by Iran to rebuild it would be met with the same determination and intensity.

Iran has consistently denied seeking a nuclear weapon while defending its ""legitimate rights"" to the peaceful use of atomic energy.

The Israeli attacks on Iran killed at least 627 civilians, Tehran's Health Ministry said. Iran's strikes on Israel killed 28 people, according to Israeli figures."

Last May, Spain formally recognised Palestine as an independent state, alongside Ireland and Norway — a move Sanchez described as ""historic"" and consistent with international law.

He said the step aimed to support peace, not target any party, and reaffirmed Spain’s commitment to a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.

Aid workers report dozens killed

Gaza's civil defence agency meanwhile said Israeli forces had killed at least 76 people on Thursday alone.

Mohammad al Mughair, the director of medical supplies in the agency, said the toll came amid increasing Israeli violence around aid distribution points.

More than 56,000 Palestinians — mostly civilians — have been killed in Gaza since October, according to health officials in the territory.

The UN recognises the health ministry’s figures as credible.

Some 11,000 Palestinians are feared buried under rubble of annihilated homes, according to Palestine's official WAFA news agency.

Experts, however, contend that the actual death toll significantly exceeds what the Gaza authorities have reported, estimating it could be around 200,000.

Gaza's population of over two million faces widespread hunger after nearly nine months of attacks and blockades by Israel.

While Israel began allowing limited aid into the territory in late May, the UN and rights groups say food and medicine remain scarce and distribution is chaotic, with frequent reports of Israeli forces firing on civilians gathering for rations.

Gaza's Health Ministry says Israel has killed nearly 550 people near aid distribution points since late May."

According to the New York Times, a group of billionaires, hedge-fund investors, and influential corporate bigwigs met with NYC Mayor Eric Adams in Lower Manhattan, to discuss how to blunt Mamdani's momentum and shore up Adams' re‑election bid. Billionaire Daniel S. Loeb, aviation investor Rob Wiesenthal, real‑estate broker Michael Lorber, crypto entrepreneur Shayne Coplan, real estate tycoon and developer Meyer Orbach were among those present, the Times reported. One participant described the mood as ""urgent,"" with attendees weighing advertising blitzes and legal manoeuvres to stop Mamdani.

A few hours later, standing on the steps of City Hall, Adams sketched the argument he plans to take to voters, promising, ""blue‑collar"" leadership against ""silver‑spoon"" promises.

""This election is a choice between a candidate with a blue collar and one with a silver spoon,"" Adams said. ""A choice between dirty fingernails and manicured nails.""

Earlier, Loeb, a long‑time Adams ally, signalled his alarm on social media, writing, ""It's officially hot commie summer.""

The unease over Mamdani's policies, including proposals for higher taxes on the wealthy, rent freezes, and city-run grocery stores, has unnerved Wall Street and the wealthy class in NYC.

Scott Rechler, chief executive of RXR, told the Times he would line up behind Adams if the race narrowed to the socialist challenger and the scandal‑scarred incumbent. ""You want to have leadership that speaks to what New York is,"" Rechler said.

""It's the capital of capitalism.""Hedge‑fund billionaire Bill Ackman wrote on X that he was examining every possible legal path to keep Mamdani from City Hall.

""There are hundreds of million of dollars of capital available to back a competitor to Mamdani that can be put together overnight (believe me, I am in the text strings and the WhatsApp groups) so that a great alternative candidate won't spend any time raising funds,"" he noted.

Grocery magnate John Catsimatidis, asked on his radio show about the prospect of a mayor who favours rent freezes and city‑run supermarkets, warned he might sell or franchise his Gristedes stores rather than operate under Mamdani.

Some of the most prominent industry titans like Reed Hastings, Barry Diller, Alice Walton, Ken Griffin, William Lauder, and Steven Roth have reportedly expressed similar reservations in recent donor calls, according to people familiar with those conversations. Collectively, they represent a war chest far larger than any New York candidate can raise through public matching funds.

Mamdani's camp argues the backlash only underscores how sharply the race has turned.

""They're scared of our plan to tax them a little bit more to fund an agenda that lowers costs and raises quality of life for everyone else,"" campaign spokesperson Andrew Epstein said in an interview.

Born to South Asian parents and raised in New York, Mamdani first organised tenants facing eviction and helped lead rideshare‑driver strikes. At rallies, he reminds voters that many families now spend a majority of their income just to stay housed and that life expectancy can vary by a subway ride.

He punctuates those statistics with selfies and jokes in fluent English, Urdu, and Swahili, a style that has turned street‑corner speeches into viral clips.

His next hurdle is the general election, where he could face a crowded field: Adams running as an independent and Republican guardian‑angel founder Curtis Sliwa, among others. Cuomo, bruised by Tuesday's loss, has yet to decide whether to mount an independent run of his own.

Tugboat muscling an ocean liner

Negative ads are already in the works, several consultants confirmed.

One strategist who has worked for Adams predicted the barrage will be ""harder than anything we saw against AOC,"" invoking the 2018 race that toppled Congressman Joe Crowley.

The online pushback has turned uglier by the hour.

Civil‑rights monitors say hundreds of Islamophobic posts flooded X within a day of Mamdani's win, some comparing his rise to 9/11 attacks.

Attacks on Mamdani have only increased, but he is used to them.

""I get messages that say the only good Muslim is a dead Muslim. I get threats on my life, on the people that I love,"" Mamdani said last week, his voice trembling with emotion.

The candidate’s aides insist the vitriol has only hardened his resolve; the campaign claims thousands of door‑knockers and an average donation well under the triple‑digit mark, figures the city's Campaign Finance Board will verify this summer.

Veteran operatives liken the contest to a tugboat muscling an ocean liner. Mamdani is now gearing to persuade the average New Yorker, shopkeepers nervous about crime, retirees wary of their pensions, and a press corps primed for scandal, all while facing opponents bankrolled by fortunes that could fund a small nation’s budget.

Across the East River, Mamdani's supporters — a mix of young boys and girls, seasoned organisers, first-time volunteers, and borough diehards — are quietly preparing for the long haul.

Notwithstanding the spectacular victory in the primaries this week, the young and working-class in NYC understand the scale of what lies ahead: their candidate, a 33-year-old brown, Muslim democratic socialist, is poised to take on one of the most entrenched power structures in American domestic politics.Mamdani has a message for them: ""Hope, in this city, is righteous. This is the dawn of something new."""

""The bill that was approved by parliament and has been approved by the Guardian Council today... is binding on us and there is no doubt about its implementation,"" Araghchi told state television.

""From now on, our relationship and cooperation with the [International Atomic Energy Agency] IAEA Agency will take a new form.""

The law is seen as a direct response to Israel and the United States' attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities over the past weeks.

Araghchi said the damage inflicted during the conflict was ""significant"" and that experts from the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran are still assessing the scale of destruction.

He also said the issue of reparations is now a top priority for the government.

Dismissing reports of talks with US

Meanwhile, US officials and sources familiar with the matter told CNN that the Trump administration has been engaged in secret diplomatic efforts to restart nuclear talks with Tehran.

The administration is reportedly exploring options that include easing sanctions, allowing access to restricted funds, and potentially backing a $20–30 billion civilian nuclear programme that excludes uranium enrichment.

Despite US President Donald Trump saying he expects talks to begin ""next week,"" Araghchi dismissed such claims.

Araghchi shut down what he said was ""speculation"" that Tehran would come to the table and said it ""should not be taken seriously"".

""I would like to state clearly that no agreement, arrangement or conversation has been made to start new negotiations,"" he said on state television. ""No plan has been set yet to start negotiations.""

In a televised speech — his first appearance since a ceasefire in the war with Israel —Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei hailed what he described as Iran's ""victory"" over Israel, vowed never to yield to US pressure and insisted Washington had been dealt a humiliating ""slap"".

""The American president exaggerated events in unusual ways, and it turned out that he needed this exaggeration,"" Khamenei said, rejecting US claims Iran's nuclear programme had been set back by decades.

White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt clarified that while the US remains in close contact with Iran — mostly through intermediaries — no talks have been scheduled yet.

""We are always focused on diplomacy and peace,"" she said.

""We want Iran to agree to a peaceful civilian nuclear programme without enrichment.""

The Trump administration's current approach would see Iran import enriched uranium rather than produce it, similar to the model used by the United Arab Emirates.

Talks between the two countries had previously reached a fifth round before being derailed by Israeli attacks.

The sixth round, scheduled to take place in Oman, was cancelled."

""What we are doing in Gaza is not working. The war has reached a stalemate,"" Lapid wrote on X on Thursday.

""It's time to end the war. Leadership must know when to change strategy when it no longer succeeds.""

His remarks follow the killings of seven Israeli soldiers inside an armoured personnel carrier during a Hamas ambush in Khan Younis on Tuesday.

Lapid criticised the government for leaving soldiers ""as targets for further attacks"" and questioned the ongoing genocide, saying: ""No one understands anymore what we are gaining from all this.""

He renewed his call for a deal to return Israeli captives — estimated at around 50, with 20 believed to be alive — and proposed involving Egypt in managing Gaza post-war.

""We must let Egypt manage the Strip while the Israeli army redeploys around Gaza to deter threats, stop smuggling, and choke Hamas economically,"" Lapid said.

He emphasised that defeating Hamas ""won't come by draining our soldiers inside Gaza, but through strategy, organisation, and smart timing.""

Mickey Levy, member of the Knesset and former Knesset Speaker, threw support behind Lapid, saying, ""We must stop.""

""This war has turned into a war of attrition without direction. It's time for a deal,"" Levy said on X.

Lapid's comments add to growing criticism of Netanyahu, whose government is accused of prolonging the genocide for political survival.

Families of captives and dead soldiers, as well as parts of the Israeli opposition, have accused Netanyahu of catering to far-right factions in his cabinet.

In February, Egypt rejected a previous proposal by Lapid that Cairo administer Gaza for 15 years in exchange for debt relief.

His latest comments come as international attention shifts back to Gaza following a 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran and amid US President Donald Trump's statement that a ceasefire in Gaza is now ""very close.""

Palestinians have reported over 56,300 fatalities caused by Israel’s ongoing genocide, many of them women and children.

Some 11,000 Palestinians are feared buried under rubble of annihilated homes, according to Palestine's official WAFA news agency.

Experts, however, contend that the actual death toll significantly exceeds what the Gaza authorities have reported, estimating it could be around 200,000.

Over the course of the genocide, Israel has also reduced most of the enclave to ruins and practically displaced the entire 2.3 million population.

It has also blocked the entry of desperately needed humanitarian aid and allowed the controversial so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a US-backed aid group established to bypass the UN aid work and criticised for being a ""death trap.""

Last November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave."

“We have not given up on the F-35s,” Erdogan told reporters aboard his return flight from the NATO summit in The Hague.

“We are discussing our intention to rejoin the project with our counterparts. Türkiye was unfairly removed from the programme.”

Türkiye was among the eight countries that joined the US in developing the multipurpose aircraft.

“The F-35 programme is as much a political process as it is a technical one,” Erdogan said. “We have always criticised this (Türkiye removal) move as incompatible with the spirit of alliance.

“We addressed the issue during our meetings with Mr. Trump, and technical-level talks were initiated. Hopefully, we will make progress.”

Türkiye was sidelined from the programme after Ankara purchased the S-400 air defence system from Russia.

But Erdogan played down the relevance of the Russian air defence system, saying the S-400 didn’t come up in discussions with Trump.

“That (S-400) is a finished business.”

“The air defence system does not end with the S-400s alone. We are developing our own Iron Dome,” he stated.

Erdogan said Ankara is building a “system of systems,” including domestic missile defence projects such as SİPER, HİSAR, SUNGUR, and the national combat aircraft KAAN.

Erdogan highlighted NATO’s commitment to increase defence spending to 5 percent of GDP over the next decade, noting that Türkiye is already among the countries closest to reaching the target.

He stressed the importance of removing restrictions among allies, particularly in the field of defence industry cooperation.

Erdogan also confirmed that Türkiye will host the 2026 NATO Leaders Summit.

Türkiye remains steadfast in its role as a mediator in the Ukraine–Russia conflict, Erdogan said, reiterating his commitment to restarting the stalled Istanbul Process, proposing to host a third round of peace talks.

“Even if everyone else gives up on peace, we will not,” he said, revealing that both Kiev and Moscow continue to express trust in Türkiye’s mediation.

Erdogan also disclosed that Trump, with whom he held a bilateral meeting during the summit, voiced support for such a summit.

“If Putin comes to Istanbul or Ankara for a resolution, I will come too,” Trump reportedly told Erdoğan."

Although bandits have no ideological agenda and are motivated by financial gains, their increasing alliance with militants from the northeast has been a source of concern for authorities and security analysts.

“Members of Zamfara Civilian Protection Guard (CPG), a state-backed militia, stormed the stronghold of Bello Turji, a notorious ""bandit"" kingpin,” said Ahmad Manga, security adviser to the state governor of Zamfara.

The CPG were supported by Nigeria's secret police (DSS) and militia members invited by the state government from northeastern Borno, where they are also assisting the military in fighting armed groups.

""The coalition took the fight to Turji's stronghold in Shinkafi district, where he lost more than 100 fighters in the battle,"" Manga said, adding that the attack was led by Bashari Maniya, a former bandit who is now assisting the government, which was aimed at getting Turji, dead or alive.

A security source confirmed the incident, saying Turji had learned about the plans in advance and invited fighters from other bandit camps to fight off the attack.

""It will be hard to give an exact number, but the toll is quite huge on the bandits’ side,” the source said.

Bandit violence in Nigeria has evolved from clashes between Fulani herders and farmers over resources in the impoverished country into a broader conflict fueled by arms trafficking.

Increasing cooperation between the criminal gangs in the northwest and militants in the northeast has seen attacks get worse.

Turji, 31, dumped herding for cattle rustling and kidnapping for ransom in 2011 in his native Shinkafi town, terrorising communities in Zamfara and neighbouring Sokoto state.

The kingpin had made several peace agreements with Zamfara state authorities, only to renege later."

The Bank said the grant will finance the rehabilitation of power infrastructure severely damaged by 14 years of conflict, which has left much of the country plagued by fuel shortages and rolling blackouts.

Syrian Energy Minister Mohammed al Bashir welcomed the decision, saying the funds would support “strategic projects,” including reconnecting Syria’s electricity grid with those of neighbouring Türkiye and Jordan.

“This is an important milestone for Syria’s energy security and economic recovery,” al Bashir said in a post on X, thanking the World Bank for its support.

The announcement comes amid Türkiye’s increasing support in Syria’s post-war reconstruction.

In May, Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar announced a major bilateral energy deal under which Ankara will supply Syria with two billion cubic meters of natural gas annually. The agreement is expected to enable the generation of up to 1,300 megawatts of electricity and ease Syria’s chronic power shortages.

Türkiye will also directly supply an additional 1,000 megawatts of electricity to Syria to help cover immediate needs, Bayraktar said during a visit to Damascus. The gas and electricity deal was seen as a signal of Ankara’s long-term strategic commitment to Syria’s stabilisation and recovery.

Just days later, Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz hosted Syrian President Ahmad al Sharaa in Ankara for high-level talks on rebuilding Syria’s economy. Both sides explored a roadmap for financial and structural reforms designed to attract investment, rebuild public services, and lay the foundation for a broader post-sanctions recovery.

Fragile recovery, long road ahead

Despite growing international and regional engagement, Syria’s path to recovery remains complex and fragile.

Large parts of the country’s energy infrastructure have been destroyed or fallen into disrepair, and international donors remain wary of providing reconstruction funds amid political uncertainty and unresolved humanitarian concerns.

Still, Thursday’s announcement suggests some momentum is building. The World Bank grant, coupled with Türkiye’s expanding role as a regional guarantor and energy partner, could signal a shift toward more coordinated international efforts to address Syria’s urgent development needs."

But, their efforts were unsuccessful, and they have now shifted their focus to targeting Mamdani.","Billionaires Bill Ackman and Elon Musk have targeted New York City councilman Zohran Mamdani's victory in the city's Democratic primary, expressing alarm over his progressive platform and influence within the party.

Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman from Queens and self-described democratic socialist, received the largest share of votes in the June 24 ranked-choice primary, placing ahead of former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Comptroller Brad Lander.

The win puts him in a strong position heading into the general election in November.

Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who backed both Cuomo's campaign and Donald Trump's 2024 presidential bid, reposted several criticisms of Mamdani's campaign on X, describing it as a turning point for the city.

He pointed to New York Times data suggesting Mamdani performed strongest in higher-income districts, while Cuomo did better in lower-income areas.

""If we allow 9.1 percent of registered voters to determine the future of New York City, then we deserve the city that we are going to get,"" Ackman wrote.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk reacted with a laughing emoji to a post referencing Mamdani's past statement: ""Queer liberation means defund the police,"" appearing to mock the phrase.

Mamdani has promoted policies such as free public transport, rent control, and higher taxes on the wealthy — positions that have drawn sharp criticism from business and financial leaders.

Billionaire US President Donald Trump also took aim at Mamdani on social media, calling him ""a 100% Communist Lunatic.""

""We've had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous,"" the president wrote. ""Yes, this is a big moment in the History of our Country.""

'It's not a done deal'

Daniel Loeb, a billionaire hedge fund manager, reportedly donated $250,000 to support Cuomo and oppose Mamdani.

In response to Mamdani's primary win, Loeb declared ""it's officially hot commie summer"". He also slammed New York Governor Kathy Hochul as ""a clueless, unqualified buffoon"".

Real estate developer John Catsimatidis said the result could push wealthy residents and investors out of New York.

He predicted that current Mayor Eric Adams — now running as an independent — could still win re-election if enough support from the business community consolidates around him.

""It's not a done deal, but Cuomo screwed up real big because he tried to do what President Biden did and hide in the basement for two months,"" Republican billionaire Catsimatidis told Forbes, adding ""if he (Adams) has Trump's help in cleaning up the streets of New York... has a chance to be a winner.""

The final outcome of the ranked-choice primary is still pending as vote tabulation continues.

Both Cuomo and Adams are now considering running in the general election as independents, setting up a possible three-way race in November.

Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 amid allegations of sexual misconduct, has yet to make a final decision.

Mamdani's win is widely viewed as a rebuke of the Democratic establishment and a signal of growing support for younger, progressive voices in city politics.

Mamdani currently holds around 43.5 percent of first-choice votes."

According to a Justice Department letter dated June 13, first reported by the Dallas Morning News on Wednesday, the department informed the group developing the project that it is dropping the investigation.

""CCP (Community Capital Partners) has affirmed that all will be welcome in any future development, and that you plan to revise and develop marketing materials to reinforce that message, consistent with your obligations under the Fair Housing Act,"" the letter reads.

""Based on this information, the Department is closing its investigation at this time.""

Earlier this year, the department opened an investigation into the proposed EPIC City project upon Senator John Cornyn's call, who baselessly claimed it could discriminate against Christians and Jews.

The developers complained they have been bullied since then by federal and state probes because they are Muslim.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the country's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation, welcomed the closure of the investigation, saying it sends a clear message to Texas officials to follow suit.

""We welcome the dropping of this investigation and hope the DOJ's actions send a clear message to the governor and other officials in Texas that they should similarly drop their Islamophobic witch hunt targeting Muslims in that state,"" CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said in a statement.

""Elected officials should respect the Constitution and serve all state residents instead of abusing their authority to discriminate against Muslims,"" he added.

CAIR previously urged the DOJ not to carry out the investigation, describing it as ""a baseless and bigoted effort to stigmatise Muslim civic engagement and religious expression.""

In April, Governor Greg Abbott said the construction of the EPIC City (East Plano Islamic Center) may not begin due to a lack of required authorisation.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality then sent a letter to EPIC affiliates to warn them against any construction activities, saying it would be against the state's law.

The project includes 1,000 homes and apartments, a faith-based school, a community college, and athletic fields.

It would take years to finish, and developers said they won't start the permitting process for several more months."

Zohran Mamdani sent shockwaves through the US political class on Tuesday, dispatching former Governor Andrew Cuomo in a rout and emerging as the presumptive Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City. This seismic ascent now positions him on the brink of leading one of the world's most storied cities.

""Democrats are looking for something fresh,"" Paul M. Collins, Jr., professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, tells TRT World. ""Young Democratic voters in particular are rejecting the old guard of the party and see Mamdani as bringing a new perspective.""

That perspective belongs to Mamdani, an Indian-origin, Ugandan-born, Queens-raised, state assemblyman who dismantled the very foundations of what used to be considered electable in NYC. For Mamdani, there has been no corporate political action committee (PAC) money. No glossy TV ad blitzes. No deference to the centrist playbook that made household names out of Clintons and Cuomos.

""This is a turning point,"" Jordan Zane, a 26-year-old organiser from Crown Heights tells TRT World on the phone. ""We're not interested in the politics of survival anymore. We want dignity, homes, transit and truth. Zohran (Mamdani) seems to understand that.""

Cuomo's fall, Mamdani's rise

Cuomo's attempt at a comeback was meant to be the story. A dynastic name with deep coffers, network muscle, and, still, a smirk of confidence. But the shadow of scandal proved too long.

Cuomo, once the commanding governor who guided New York through the pandemic before resigning under a cloud of harassment allegations, now looked like a relic in a city teeming with younger voices.

""Mamdani’s victory,"" says Collins, ""can be cautiously viewed as a sign that Democrats are turning away from the party's old guard and embracing Mamdani as a fresh voice.""

Mamdani didn't win on his own.

He rode a wave — a cresting, churning coalition of white progressives from brownstone Brooklyn, working-class Asians and Latinos in Queens, and a kaleidoscopic mix of students and artists sprinkled across Manhattan.

Their connective tissue wasn't race or religion, but rage at the rent, subway delays, empty fridges, and an unshakeable feeling that the city wasn't theirs anymore.

Shift from old politics

His base had its blind spots, too.

He failed to win in several Black precincts where long-standing ties to centrist leadership remain strong, and he struggled in many Orthodox Jewish pockets, where his vocal support for Palestinian rights alienated traditional voters.

But that didn't stop the groundswell. His X posts — clear, confrontational — echoed his stance. ""Israel is committing a genocide,"" he wrote on October 31 last year. He's also stood firm in his backing of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, calling it ""the core of my politics, which is non-violence.""

Those positions drew fire. Conservative commentators, Wall Street veterans, and political foes unloaded.

Dan Loeb, hedge fund billionaire and ardent Cuomo backer, fumed online: ""It's officially hot commie summer.""

Former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer, however, saw a different story: ""What's happening in NYC is a blaringly loud message to those in the Dem establishment who still cling to old politics… too afraid to say what needs to be said.""

The centre can't hold

Wall Street gasped. Midtown lobbyists picked up their phones. Conservative media lit up. And over on Truth Social, US President Donald Trump posted: ""Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary… We've had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous.""

But Collins isn't convinced the sky is falling.

""The business community and wealthy elites will talk a big game about pulling out of New York City, but ultimately, I doubt it will happen. Those businesses chose New York for a reason. It's hard to imagine a single mayorship will be enough to get them to pull out of the Big Apple.""

Still, the challenges ahead are real.

New York remains a complex city to govern. Public unions, real estate titans, police departments, and the ever-fickle winds of public opinion — all loom large.

""It's going to be challenging for Mamdani to find middle ground,"" says Collins.

""His best bet is probably to focus on what matters most to many people: the cost of living.""

And that's where Mamdani has been most effective. He has spoken about rent freezes. Subsidised housing. Free transit.

""A lot of us young people are thrilled that Zohran wants to tax the super-wealthy and put government back where it belongs, in the lives of those this city has long ignored,"" adds Zane, a Mamdani voter.

It wasn't just Mamdani. Progressives held their ground across the city. Council members Shahana Hanif, Alexa Aviles, and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams all won re-election.

The signal was clear: NYC's political current is flowing left.

And the national Democratic establishment? Still blinking. Trying to figure out how a 33-year-old with no endorsement from Schumer or Biden or Clinton or any bigwig and with a firmly pro-Palestine stance just became the presumptive mayor of NYC.

Rachel Williams, a DC-based strategist, tells TRT World, ""Mamdani has been strident in his criticism of Israel's war on Gaza. He has also been a strong supporter of BDS movement.""

""For many within the Democratic party,"" she adds, ""he's now the test case, whether being unapologetically progressive is still electable.""

As for what's next, the mayoral election is set for November 4.

Mamdani will face Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa, 71, red-beret-toting Guardian Angels founder who lost badly in 2021 and is widely expected to fall short again.

Williams puts it plainly, ""What a time to be alive in America!""

Trump added that while the United States had ""saved"" Israel during the recent conflict with Iran, ""now it will be Israel's turn to save Netanyahu.""

He characterised Netanyahu as Israel's most courageous and capable leader.

Bribery, fraud and breach of trust

Trump's remarks mark a noticeable shift — or at least a public acknowledgement — of improved ties between the two men, after reports of serious tension in recent years.

Previous disagreements reportedly stemmed from several issues, including the Israeli genocide in Gaza and the relationship with Iran before the latest escalation.

Analysts said the strain became especially clear during Trump's recent Middle East tour, which notably excluded Israel — a first for a US president.

In the days leading up to that visit, Trump negotiated a ceasefire with Yemen's Houthis without demanding they halt strikes on Israeli targets.

He also approved direct talks with Hamas, during which his team reportedly agreed to facilitate urgent humanitarian aid into Gaza in exchange for the release of a US-Israeli dual national.

Netanyahu's trial — on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust — has been ongoing since 2020.

The trial has been delayed many times since then, with Netanyahu managing postponements due to Gaza genocide and later conflict in Lebanon.

In a first case, Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, are accused of accepting more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods such as cigars, jewellery and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favours.

Two other cases allege that Netanyahu attempted to negotiate more favourable coverage in two Israeli media outlets.

He denies all wrongdoing.

Netanyahu also faces charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, with the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants for him and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant in November 2024 over atrocities in Gaza, where Palestinians have documented 56,000 fatalities, mostly women and children.

Some 11,000 Palestinians are feared buried under rubble of annihilated homes, according to Palestine's official WAFA news agency.

Experts, however, contend that the actual death toll significantly exceeds what the Gaza authorities have reported, estimating it could be around 200,000.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice.

Washington allocates $3.8 billion in annual military funding to its long-standing ally Israel.

Since October 2023, the US has spent more than $22 billion supporting Israel's genocide in Gaza and wars in neighbouring countries.

Despite senior US officials criticising Israel regarding the high civilian death toll in Gaza, Washington has, thus far, resisted calls to place conditions on any arms transfers."

Three Palestinians were killed in Kafr Malik, a village northeast of Ramallah, where dozens of illegal Israeli settlers stormed the area, set vehicles on fire and attacked residents, the ministry said.

At least seven others were wounded, including one person in critical condition.

The Palestinian Red Crescent confirmed that a 14-year-old boy was killed after being shot by Israeli military in the town of Yamun, near Jenin.

Witnesses said that Israeli occupation soldiers stormed homes and businesses in the area, triggering confrontations.

Elsewhere, illegal Zionist settlers assaulted a resident in the village of Asira al-Qibliya near Nablus, pelting him with stones and wounding him, according to the local village council.

Settlers also torched about 10 dunams of farmland and opened fire at Palestinians trying to extinguish the flames.

Israeli troops also carried out a 16-hour military invasion in Yabad, a town in the northern occupied West Bank.

Residents said forces blocked all entrances and imposed a curfew during the raid.

In Jenin city, Israeli troops raided several stores and fired tear gas at residents, according to local reports.

Nearly 1,000 Palestinians killed since Gaza genocide

Since Israel's genocide in Gaza began on October 7, 2023, at least 977 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank and more than 7,000 wounded by Israeli troops and illegal settlers, the Health Ministry said.

Israel has driven nearly 40,000 Palestinians from their homes in the occupied West Bank since October 2023.

As Israel's raids have largely destroyed urban refugee camps like Tulkarem and Nur Shams, thousands are now stranded with nowhere to return.

Last year, the International Court of Justice issued a non-binding opinion declaring Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Israel occupied the West Bank, along with Gaza and East Jerusalem, in the 1967 Arab-Israel war.

Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but has maintained it under harsh siege by land, air, and sea since then. It again invaded the small enclave since October 2023.

Israel has already built well over 100 Zionist settlements across the occupied territories that are home to some 500,000 illegal settlers.

The settlements range from small hilltop outposts to fully developed communities with apartment blocks, shopping malls, factories and public parks — all considered illegal by the international community.

The occupied West Bank is home to three million Palestinians, who live under brutal Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centres.

The Zionist settlers hold Israeli citizenship. Tens of thousands of them have dual US-Israeli citizenship."

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump claimed recent US air strikes had led to the ""total obliteration"" of Iran's nuclear capabilities, setting the programme back ""decades"".

He added that the ceasefire he announced earlier in the week was ""going very well.""

However, a leaked US intelligence assessment seen by American media suggested the strikes may have delayed Iran's nuclear efforts by only a few months.

The United States joined the fighting in support of Israel, targeting three nuclear facilities in Iran.

Two were hit by bunker-buster bombs, while the third was struck by a guided missile fired from a US submarine.

""They're not going to be building bombs for a long time,"" Trump said, adding that discussions with Iran were expected ""next week.""

He added: ""We may sign an agreement. I don’t know.""

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government is open to talks, but would continue to ""assert its legitimate rights"" to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei said that some nuclear sites had been ""badly damaged.""

But the US Defense Intelligence Agency, in a report cited by US outlets, claimed the American strikes did not destroy Iran’s centrifuges or its stockpiles of enriched uranium.

Instead, some facility entrances were sealed without eliminating underground structures.

Trump's intelligence chiefs also pushed back on Wednesday.

CIA Director John Radcliffe in a statement said that new intelligence from a ""historically reliable"" source indicated that ""several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years.""

Trump also said on Wednesday that the US has not given up its maximum pressure on Iran - including restrictions on sales of Iranian oil - but signaled a potential easing in enforcement to help the country rebuild.

""They're going to need money to put that country back into shape. We want to see that happen,"" Trump said at a news conference at the NATO Summit when asked if he was easing oil sanctions on Iran.

US hits back at accounts Iran moved uranium

Also on Wednesday, the White House rejected reports that Iran moved enriched uranium before US air strikes.

""I can tell you, the United States had no indication that that enriched uranium was moved prior to the strikes, as I also saw falsely reported,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.

""As for what's on the ground right now, it's buried under miles and miles of rubble because of the success of these strikes on Saturday evening,"" she said.

Some US media had cited concerns that around 400 kilogrammes of enriched uranium may have been relocated before the strikes — possibly hidden elsewhere in the country.

The quantity of uranium had been reported by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, with which Iran is considering severing cooperation after the Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear programme.

""The IAEA lost visibility on this material the moment hostilities began,"" the agency's chief, Rafael Grossi, told France 2 television. But he added: ""I don't want to give the impression that it's been lost or hidden.""

The 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel was the most intense confrontation between the two sides to date.

Israeli aggression hit nuclear and military targets, as well as civilian areas, killing hundreds including scientists and senior military officials, according to Iran's Health Ministry.

It stated that at least 627 civilians were killed, the majority of whom were civilians.

Iran's missile and drone attacks left 28 people dead in Israel while destroying dozens of buildings and causing Tel Aviv billions in losses."

Trump said the summit achieved ""tremendous things"", with a renewed focus on urging European allies to shoulder more of the military burden and invest in defence hardware.

""The major focus was on the need for NATO members to take up the burden for Europe's defence,"" Trump said. ""Additional money should be spent on military hardware.""

Trump also weighed in on the recent escalation between Iran and Israel, declaring the conflict ""finished"" after what he described as intense behind-the-scenes diplomacy.

""I dealt with both and they're both tired, exhausted,"" he said, when asked why he believed the fighting had ended.

""They fought very, very hard and very viciously, very violently, and they were both satisfied to go home and get out,"" Trump added.

Trump said talks with Iranian officials are scheduled for next week and hinted at the possibility of a new agreement, though he downplayed the urgency.

""A deal may be signed,"" he said, adding, ""I don't think it's that necessary.""

US strikes 'set back' Iran's nuclear programme

Reflecting on recent US military operations in the Middle East, Trump confirmed that last week's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities had severely crippled the country's capabilities.

""Our strikes on Fordow destroyed the enrichment site's critical infrastructure and rendered it totally inoperable,"" Trump said.

""These strikes have set back Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons for many years to come. This achievement can benefit indefinitely if Iran does not get access to nuclear material, which it won't.""

He added that the Ukraine crisis had underscored the urgent need to rebuild the defence industrial base in both the US and allied nations.

'Nice' meeting with Zelenskyy

The US president also described his high-profile meeting in The Hague with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as cordial and constructive.

""You know, we had a little rough times sometimes, but he couldn't have been nicer,"" Trump said, apparently alluding to a past Oval Office shouting match between the two leaders.

The summit also saw the announcement that Türkiye will host the 2026 NATO Summit, marking a significant moment for the country’s role within the alliance.

Erdogan met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, where the two leaders discussed enhancing cooperation between Türkiye and the United Kingdom. Emphasising a shared goal of increasing bilateral trade to $30 billion, Erdogan highlighted the growing collaboration in the defence sector.

He reiterated Türkiye’s commitment to supporting peace efforts between Russia and Ukraine, and voiced concern over the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, calling for an enduring ceasefire and the protection of international law in Palestine.

He expressed hope that Iran and Israel will adhere to the ceasefire, stressing that the escalation must not be allowed to overshadow the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He also underlined that the violations of international law by the Netanyahu government in Palestine are unacceptable, and that Türkiye’s priority is the establishment of a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid.

Erdogan also warned that Israeli strikes in Syria could destabilise the region and reaffirmed Türkiye’s support for a politically unified Syria to enable the safe return of refugees.

In a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Erdogan stressed the need to translate the current ceasefire between Israel and Iran into long-term stability.

The leaders discussed ways to strengthen Türkiye-France relations and exchanged views on European security.

He noted that including non-EU allies in Europe’s new security and defence architecture would be beneficial and emphasised the importance of approaching Türkiye-European Union relations from a long-term and strategic perspective.

He also urged an immediate and lasting ceasefire in Gaza, citing the worsening humanitarian crisis.

Erdogan also stated that Syria has been acting cautiously to remain outside the scope of regional conflicts and underlined the importance of Israel recognising that ensuring its own security depends on the stability of its neighbors.

During talks with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Erdogan affirmed the strong ties between Türkiye and Germany. He expressed hope for expanding cooperation in areas such as trade, energy, and defence in the new period.

The president reiterated Türkiye’s determination to deepen its engagement with the European Union, and called for a similar constructive approach from the EU.

On regional issues, he emphasised the need for a just peace in Ukraine and lasting calm between Israel and Iran. He also highlighted the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza and stressed that improving social and economic conditions in Syria is essential to enable the return of refugees.

Chancellor Merz, for his part, praised Türkiye’s diplomatic efforts, particularly its role in mediating a potential ceasefire and peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

“I thanked him for Türkiye’s willingness to take on a mediating role, including offering Istanbul or Ankara as venues for such a meeting,” Merz said. “I also asked President Erdogan to exert influence on Russia and the Russian president to come to the negotiating table so that, after these terrible three and a half years of war in Ukraine, a peace solution could finally be reached.”

President Erdogan also held talks with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, continuing his series of bilateral discussions during the summit. The meeting touched on bilateral relations and regional developments, as part of Türkiye’s broader diplomatic agenda.

""Law enforcement officers have foiled a large-scale and sinister plan by the 'criminal-oligarchic clergy' to destabilise the situation in the Republic of Armenia and seize power,"" he wrote on his Telegram channel.

Galstanyan, the leader of the opposition Sacred Struggle movement, last year used the regional issues with Azerbaijan to instigate protests, which ultimately failed to topple the prime minister.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to make the announcement on Wednesday at the NATO summit in the Netherlands and call on member states to strengthen their commitment to the alliance, according to an official press release.

The F-35A jets are capable of carrying conventional weapons but can also be outfitted with US-made nuclear bombs if needed.

Trump's assertion has sparked inquiries regarding US intelligence support for his decision to authorise strikes on Iran.

The Republican president made the assertion in a letter dated Monday to House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, a key ally, and it was posted on the White House's website.

""United States forces conducted a precision strike against three nuclear facilities in Iran used by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran for its nuclear weapons development program,"" Trump wrote.

Almost every organisation and institution monitoring Iran's nuclear programme concluded that there is no evidence that Tehran is pursuing a nuclear weapon.

The International Atomic Energy Agency Director General, Rafael Grossi, said in an interview that the agency had no proof that Tehran has a systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon.

The most recent US assessment, presented to Congress in March by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, said Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had not ordered the restarting of a nuclear-weapons effort shuttered in 2003.

""The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorised the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003,"" the testimony on the National Intelligence Website reads.

Gabbard, the former Democrat, took to social media on Friday and said the testimony was taken out of context, asserting that she and Trump are on the same page.

""The dishonest media is intentionally taking my testimony out of context and spreading fake news as a way to manufacture division,"" Gabbard said on X.

Iran insists that its nuclear programme is for peaceful uses.

Former US President George Bush justified the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by saying intelligence showed the country had weapons of mass destruction. This was later discredited and prompted a political backlash.

Bush himself admitted later that there were no WMDs in Iraq. He was never charged with anything.

'I don't care what she said'

Trump first cast doubt on intelligence about Iran's nuclear program last week, when he repudiated the assessment that Gabbard delivered to Congress.

""I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having one,"" Trump told reporters, referring to a nuclear weapon.

According to unclassified US intelligence reports compiled before the strikes, Iran closed a nuclear weapons programme in 2003 — a conclusion shared by the UN nuclear watchdog — and has not mastered all of the technologies required.

But Tehran does have the expertise to build a warhead at some point, according to the reports.

The US attacked three Iranian nuclear sites — Natanz, Isfahan and Fordow — on Sunday.

It hit deeply buried Fordow, where advanced centrifuges could produce low-enriched uranium for nuclear reactor fuel and highly enriched uranium for warheads, with ""bunker busting"" bombs.

Trump and other top officials said the sites were obliterated. But a preliminary US intelligence assessment found the attack set back Tehran's programme by only months.

A US official who read the assessment said it contained a number of caveats, and a more refined report was expected in the coming days and weeks."

""There was once a great President that the American people loved. He opposed Israel's nuclear programme.

And then he was assassinated,"" the Republican from Georgia posted on social media platform X on Tuesday.

""Should I feel that my life is in danger now too? What about President Trump who strongly rebuked Israel this morning for continuing to attack Iran?"" she added.

Her remarks came shortly after Trump warned Israel against launching further air strikes on Iran, calling such action a ""major violation"" of a ceasefire agreement.

Greene has also spoken out against recent US military attacks targeting Iranian nuclear sites, criticising what she described as endless foreign wars serving ""foreign interests.""

""American troops have been killed and forever torn apart physically and mentally for regime change, foreign wars, and for military industrial base profits.

I'm sick of it,"" she wrote in a separate post.

President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas in 1963.

While official investigations concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, a former US Marine, was responsible for the shooting, the killing has long been the subject of speculation and conspiracy theories.

During his presidency, Kennedy did express concern over Israel's nuclear ambitions.

In 1963, he pressed then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion for transparency over the Dimona nuclear facility, warning that continued secrecy could ""seriously jeopardise"" US support for Israel.

However, there is no publicly verified evidence linking Kennedy's death to that dispute.

The proposed 5 percent spending goal comprises two parts. The first — and most demanding — is a 3.5 percent GDP commitment to core military spending, a sharp increase from NATO’s longstanding 2 percent benchmark, which only 22 of 32 allies have met.

The second 1.5 percent includes broader investments in civilian infrastructure, cyber defence, and societal resilience — measures like upgrading roads, ports, and airfields to facilitate rapid military deployment, as well as preparations for hybrid and cyber warfare.

While most countries can meet the second category with relative ease, the 3.5 percent defence commitment poses a steep challenge, especially for countries like Spain.

Spain currently spends just 1.28 percent of its GDP on defence, NATO estimates show — the lowest in the alliance. Sanchez says his government will raise that figure to 2.1 percent, which he claims is enough to meet NATO’s “capability targets”, which deal with the specific military roles and equipment contributions assigned to each member.

Sanchez’s government is facing mounting pressure at home, where he depends on a fragile coalition and is grappling with corruption allegations affecting his political inner circle. Opposition parties have already begun pushing for early elections, complicating any effort to significantly boost military outlays.

Spain is also among Europe’s smallest contributors of military aid to Ukraine.

Rising stakes for Europe

The push for higher spending comes amid growing alarm over Russia’s war with Ukraine and signs of expanded hybrid warfare — from cyberattacks to GPS jamming and infrastructure sabotage — across the continent. NATO planners say defending Europe against a potential Russian assault requires a minimum of 3 percent of GDP in military investment.

Several frontline and northern European countries, including Germany, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the Baltic states, are expected to meet or exceed the full 5 percent target. The Netherlands alone estimates it will need to find an additional €16–19 billion ($18–22 billion) to meet its obligations.

Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares argued on Monday that the focus should be on capabilities, not just percentages. “Spain can meet the alliance’s needs with 2.1 percent,” he insisted.

A deadline in sight?

The alliance is also debating how quickly members should ramp up their spending.

A 2032 deadline has been floated, which is far more aggressive than NATO’s previous open-ended goals. But concerns about Russia’s ability to regroup militarily in the next five to 10 years are driving urgency.

While some, like Italy, are requesting a full decade to meet the target, others want a tighter timeframe. Discussions have even included a possible review in 2029 and an extended deadline to 2035 for lagging members.

Still, as Trump made clear, patience is wearing thin. “We’ve carried NATO long enough,” he said. “Now it’s their turn.”"

Is another one coming?From the British to the US, the Shia-majority nation has faced different imperialist enterprises since the late 19th century.","US President Donald Trump’s threats against Iranian leadership have once again raised the prospects of the long-standing Western ambitions of hegemony over the oil-rich, Shia-majority nation located strategically between Central Asia and the Middle East.

Trump demanded “unconditional surrender” from Tehran, in what sounded like a pompous White colonialist leader giving an ultimatum to an economically weak and militarily inferior third-world nation.

But the Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei unequivocally rejected Trump’s demand, warning him that if he attacks Tehran or attempts to invade the country of 92 million people, the US and its ally Israel will face “irreparable damage”, signalling that old colonial tactics might no longer work.

Trump’s demand has also made many Iranians recall old Western interventions, which ranged from full-scale occupation to toppling legitimate governments by using military force and covert operations for the sake of securing Western political and commercial interests.

Here is a brief history of Western involvement in Iran over the decades:

Britain used its military and commercial power to colonise large parts of the world, from the Americas to India and the Middle East, from the 17th century to the early 20th century.

In the late 19th century, Iran’s textile producers and traditional handicrafts found themselves unable to compete with imported Western products, particularly from British-ruled regions, as the then-Shah opened up the country to the West.

But in 1872, when Naser al-Din Shah, the then-shah of the Qajar dynasty, decided to allow a British businessman to collect revenues from various national industries – ranging from roads to telegraphs, mills and factories in return for just 60 percent of the net revenue – both Iranian merchants and clerics got angry. The Iranian shah eventually backed down, overwhelmed by local resistance.

Two decades later, the clerics – traditionally led by top Shia religious authorities known as ayatollahs, merchants and newly-emerged modern intellectuals, made a pact to fight against another British monopoly: on the Iranian tobacco industry.

In 1891, Ayatollah Mirza Hasan Shirazi issued a fatwa against the use of tobacco across Iran, where a British monopoly existed over its production.

Their opposition led to a nationwide protest and boycott movement against British commercial interests, primarily its tobacco monopoly, which threatened job security of many Iranians working in the agricultural sector across rural areas.

In December 1891, Mirza Hasan Shirazi, the top ayatollah of the time, issued a fatwa against the use of tobacco across Iran, describing it a grave sin under the circumstances.

Some Iran experts see that this movement laid out the ground for the country’s famous Constitutional Revolution in 1905, which limited the powers of Qajar dynasty rule.

Experts point out that the merchant-cleric alliance – also known as the bazaar-ayatollah cooperation – which showed its increasing influence over Iranian society from the 1870s to 1970s, was instrumental in ousting the Pahlavi dynasty in the 1979 Revolution.

British, Pahlavis and occupation of Iran

In 1921, Reza Pahlavi, an Iranian military officer, overthrew the Qajar dynasty in a coup, marking the start of the reign of the Pahlavi dynasty.

While the Western involvement in the Pahlavi-led coup is still subject to debate, many see signs of British collaboration with the putschists.

In August 1941 British and Soviet forces invaded Iran, judging Reza Shah Pahlavi—who had courted German advisers—too sympathetic to Berlin. They compelled him to abdicate in favour of his 21-year-old son, Mohammad Reza Shah. The younger Pahlavi ruled until the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which erupted over domestic repression and resentment of foreign influence.

Reza Shah’s refusal to expel German nationals and grant the Allies full use of Iran’s rail network prompted the Anglo-Soviet occupation. London and Moscow sought to secure the “Persian Corridor,” a vital supply route linking Gulf ports to Soviet Central Asia.

Soviet tankmen drive through the streets of Tabriz in Iran in 1941.

In 1941, Soviet-British forces invaded Iran, initiating Reza Shah’s abdication from the throne and instituting his son Mohammed Reza Pahlavi as the Iranian monarch.

The Soviet-British occupation in Iran continued until 1946, the year WWII ended.

Overthrow of Mosaddegh government (1951-53)

After WWII, the world’s new superpower, US took over the imperialist global domination project from the UK, becoming the big brother of Iranians, who did not like it from the very beginning.

The new Shah Reza Pahlavi adopted many pro-Western policies despite the dislike of large sections of the population, from clerics to native merchants and anti-imperialist intellectuals.

Then came the seminal moment of 1953 when nationalist Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh wanted to change a bizarre arrangement, which allowed the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) to own most of Iranian oil profits, leaving Tehran barely anything of the revenues from the country’s native oil industry.

The British and their senior ally US saw this attempt as a grave challenge to the Western hegemony, and orchestrated a military coup against the Mossadegh government with the help of the CIA and MI6.

While millions of pro-Mossadegh Iranians protested the Western intervention across the streets of Tehran, this time around, Shia clerics did not join them like in the past, fearing that the nationalist prime minister was allied with the country’s communists. Clerical withdrawal from the protests helped the CIA-orchestrated coup succeed against Mossadegh.

Mossadegh was punished with house arrest until his death in 1967, even being denied a public funeral despite his wish to be buried next to the killed protesters of 1952-53 in a public graveyard.

But his anti-imperialist stance left an indelible mark in Iranian memory and became one of the main rallying points in the 1979 Revolution against the pro-American Shah.

Iranian Revolution of 1979 and after

While anti-West sentiments were high in Iran, neither the US nor its allies expected that anti-Shah forces, which ranged from leftist groups to clerics like the Ayatollah Khomeini, could overthrow the pro-American secular Iranian monarch.

“Iran is not in a revolutionary or even ‘pre-revolutionary’ situation,” the CIA declared five months before the Shah was ousted by a coalition of liberals, ayatollahs and communists.

But there was even more to the West’s underestimation in regard to Iran’s Shia religious establishment’s large influence over the merchant middle-class and larger society.

There was an infamous conversation between Walter F. Mondale, the US vice president in the Jimmy Carter administration, and CIA director Stansfield Turner when Iran was on the verge of the 1979 revolution.

During the interesting exchange, the vice president asked the CIA chief a critical question: “What’s an ayatollah?” Turner, caught off by with the vice president’s question, responded: “Damned if I know, but I’ll find out and get back to you.”

Ayatollah Khomeini speaks to followers at Behesht Zahra Cemetery after his arrival in Tehran, Iran, ending 14 years of exile, Feb. 1 , 1979.

Experts do not see this as “an isolated incident in which the intelligence community failed to respond to queries from the highest levels of government.”

As a result, the US failed to understand the coming of the 1979 Revolution, which overthrew the pro-West Shah alongside its secular allies.

Since then, the West has used different punitive measures – from sanctions to political pressure and military threats against Iran’s successive elected governments.

During the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, the West has once again shown its interventionist nature rooted in its colonialist past, urging a regime change in Tehran, apparently with the aim of installing a pro-Western government on good terms with Zionism.

Israel has even threatened to kill Khamenei, Iran’s top ayatollah.

But analysts warn that the killing of the supreme leader might lead to even more hardline governance under Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), a post-revolutionary military force."

The warring African nations said in a joint statement on Wednesday that they had initialed an agreement aimed at ending the conflict in eastern DRC — to be formally signed in the US capital next week.

""This is a Great Day for Africa and, quite frankly, a Great Day for the World!"" Trump said in a Truth Social post confirming the breakthrough.

But Trump also complained that he had been overlooked by the Norwegian Nobel Committee for his mediating role in conflicts between India and Pakistan, as well as Serbia and Kosovo.

He also demanded credit for ""keeping peace"" between Egypt and Ethiopia and brokering the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements aiming to normalise relations between Israel and several Arab nations.

Trump campaigned for office as a ""peacemaker"" who would use his negotiating skills to quickly end war in Ukraine and Gaza genocide, although both conflicts are still raging five months into his presidency.

Indian officials have denied that he had any role in its ceasefire with Pakistan. Islamabad has however acknowledged Trump's role and nominated him for 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.

The president said officials from DRC and Rwanda would be in Washington on Monday for their signing, although their joint statement said they would put pen to paper on June 27.

The resource-rich eastern DRC, which borders Rwanda, has been plagued by violence for three decades, with a resurgence since the anti-government M23 armed group went on a renewed offensive at the end of 2021.

The deal — which builds on a declaration of principles signed in April — was reached during three days of talks between the neighbors in Washington, according to their statement.

Trump has received multiple Nobel Peace Prize nominations from supporters and loyal lawmakers over the years.

He has made no secret of his irritation at missing out on the prestigious award, bringing it up as recently as February during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

President Barack Obama won the prize soon after taking office in 2009, and Trump complained during his 2024 election campaign that his Democratic predecessor was not worthy of the honour."

Just hours before meeting Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at the Dolmabahce Palace on Friday, the Armenian prime minister stepped into places few of his predecessors had ventured. His first stop was the Armenian Apostolic Church in Istanbul. The Holy Mother of God church is the Patriarchal Church of the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople, also known as the Armenian Patriarchate of Istanbul, the autonomous see of the Armenian Apostolic Church.

Then, as the call to prayer drifted across the quarter, he walked into the grand Sultanahmet Mosque. Beneath the sweep of its blue domes, Pashinyan stood still, a foreign leader cloaked in local stillness. Cameras clicked. Aides shifted, whispering in soft Turkish and Armenian. But for a beat, the moment held — sacred, shared.

Familiar, not just formalIt was, by every measure, a historic visit.

The first of its kind by an Armenian leader at this level to Türkiye. But it wasn't a stiff diplomatic exchange. It had warmth. Texture. Even a strange sort of ease.

Pashinyan met with members of Istanbul's Armenian community, some visibly moved by the gesture.

He thanked them with quiet words. He spoke of dialogue — fragile, yes. Ongoing. Real.

Later, at the Dolmabahce waterfront, President Erdogan welcomed him not just with handshakes but with familiarity.

Erdogan's office called their talks constructive, reiterating Türkiye's support for a peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan — a ""win-win,"" in the presidential office's words.

For Pashinyan, this trip was not just about geopolitics. It was also about symbolism. He needs progress: with Baku, with Ankara, with his own people.

In Istanbul, he chose to walk. Not just into a palace, but into a city layered with remembrance.

And for a day, the atmosphere among politicians, clergy, citizens was not tense or transactional, but disarmingly human. Warm. Almost palsy. The handshake wasn't just literal. It lingered.

In the end, Pashinyan seemed to soak in the hospitality of one of the world's greatest cities — Istanbul, often called the bridge between the East and West.In a city that remembers, his presence said enough."

Khalil, who had become a prominent face of pro-Palestine student protests across US campuses, walked out of a federal facility in Louisiana on Friday and is expected to return to New York to reunite with his wife and infant son, who was born while he was in detention.

""Justice prevailed, but it’s very long overdue,"" Khalil said outside the facility.

""This shouldn’t have taken three months.""

The US District Court in New Jersey ordered Khalil's release after Judge Michael Farbiarz said the government had failed to meet the legal standards for continued detention.

The judge also stated that it would be ""highly, highly unusual"" to continue detaining a legal US resident who faced no violent charges and had demonstrated a willingness to comply with court proceedings.

His release came just hours after an immigration judge denied him bond and ordered his removal from the US — a ruling the Trump administration insists overrides the district court's decision.

In a sharply worded statement, the administration accused the judge of overstepping.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has led the push to deport Khalil, invoking a Cold War-era statute allowing the removal of foreigners deemed harmful to US foreign policy.

He argues that non-citizens do not enjoy the same constitutional protections and has labelled Khalil’s activism a national security threat.

The Trump administration has claimed that participation in anti-Israel protests is tantamount to antisemitism and grounds for deportation.

Civil rights groups reject this framing, arguing it conflates criticism of Israeli policy with hate speech in an attempt to stifle dissent.

Khalil said his time in the Jena, Louisiana detention centre exposed him to ""a different reality about this country that supposedly champions human rights and liberty and justice.""

""Whether you are a US citizen, an immigrant or just a person on this land doesn’t mean that you are less of a human,"" he said.

""Justice will prevail, no matter what this administration may try to portray.""

His wife, Dr Noor Abdalla, said the ruling allowed her to ""breathe a sigh of relief,"" though it did not erase the trauma of the last three months.

""We know this ruling does not begin to address the injustices the Trump administration has brought upon our family, and so many others,"" she added.

Khalil was the first person arrested under President Donald Trump's crackdown on student protests against Israel's genocide in Gaza.

He was detained on March 8 at his apartment building in Manhattan.

While he was not among those arrested on campus, his role as a negotiator and spokesperson for student protesters made him a prominent target.

A few days after Khalil's arrest, Trump's claim came due after another pro-Palestine scholar, Badar Khan Suri, an Indian researcher at Georgetown University, was arrested.

His attorney said he was arrested because of the Palestinian identity of his wife. He was released in May.

After the arrest of Suri, authorities went after another pro-Palestine student, Momodou Taal, asking him to turn himself in.

On March 25, Yunseo Chung, a Columbia University student, said she sued the Trump administration to stop her deportation from the US over her participation in a pro-Palestine protest last Spring.

Also on March 25, Rumeysa Ozturk, who is a Tufts University PhD student, was kidnapped in broad daylight by US authorities over criticising Israel's carnage in Gaza.

On April 14, authorities arrested Mohsen Mahdawi during his citizenship interview before he was released on April 30."

The announcement comes as diplomatic engagement continues between Islamabad and Washington on a range of bilateral and regional issues, including Iran.

Shehbaz, Rubio discuss Iran-Israel tensions

Also on Friday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a phone call with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that focused on the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel.

Sharif stressed the need for a peaceful resolution to what he described as a ""grave"" crisis, and said Pakistan was ready to play a ""constructive"" role in any peace effort.

The call followed Army Chief Generla Asim Munir's meeting with Trump at the White House earlier this week, where the two discussed regional security and strategic cooperation.

Sharif also expressed support for greater Pakistan-US collaboration in areas including trade, energy, mining, and technology.

He reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to reengage with India on all outstanding disputes, including Kashmir, counter-terrorism, and water sharing.

The Pakistani military, in a separate statement, said General Munir met with policy experts, analysts, and journalists during his Washington trip, emphasising the potential for a ""multidimensional partnership"" with the US based on mutual respect and shared interests.

He reaffirmed Islamabad’s ""balanced"" approach to global and regional issues and pledged a ""responsible and proactive"" role in easing tensions and supporting collective security.

Trump, commenting after his meeting with Munir, told reporters he had ""stopped"" the war between India and Pakistan — a claim that was later denied by Indian officials.

Secretary Rubio commended Pakistan’s efforts in fighting terrorism and assured Islamabad of continued US support in tackling security threats.

Among those affected were journalists from VOA's Persian-language service, some of whom had only recently been recalled from administrative leave to report on developments in Iran following Israeli attacks.

According to the Associated Press, staff who stepped out for a break had their ID badges confiscated and were denied reentry.

Kari Lake, a senior adviser to former US President Donald Trump who now oversees the agency, said some 1,400 people — around 85 percent of the workforce — have been laid off since March.

She described the move as part of a ""long overdue effort to dismantle a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy.""

""For decades, American taxpayers have been forced to bankroll an agency plagued by dysfunction, bias, and waste,"" Lake said in a statement.

Trump closes a chapter on US state media

VOA began during World War II broadcasting messages about ""American democracy"" to audiences in Nazi Germany.

It later expanded to deliver news in dozens of languages.

The layoffs come amid a broader campaign by Trump and his allies to defund public media, including efforts to cut off funding for NPR and PBS — a proposal still under review in Congress.

Since March 15, most VOA staff had been placed on administrative leave, with broadcasts and digital output largely suspended.

Among those receiving termination notices Friday were three journalists currently engaged in legal action against the administration's decision to dismantle the network.

Several former employees expressed disappointment over the decision, calling it the end of 83 years of “independent journalism” that championed “democratic values and press freedom around the world.”

Steve Herman, VOA's chief national correspondent who is set to retire, described the layoffs as ""an historic act of self-sabotage,"" warning that the US was silencing one of its most effective soft-power tools.

While some dismissed employees are calling on Congress to intervene, Herman voiced doubt that the network could be saved — even under a more sympathetic administration.

""Every day the network remains off the air is a day audiences form new habits,"" he said.

""By the time any future government takes over, I fear Voice of America will have been forgotten.""

Other USAGM outlets hit by budget-driven closures

The layoffs extend beyond VOA.

Other entities under USAGM have also seen sweeping cuts under Trump-era funding policies aimed at phasing out much of the agency’s operations.

MBN which has Alhurra channel, the only US-funded Arabic-language TV network targeting audiences in the Middle East, carried out mass layoffs on April 12.

According to employees, while most of the editorial staff were dismissed, administrative personnel were retained — raising concerns over possible mismanagement.

One former staffer asked: ""What’s the point of keeping administrators at a media outlet if almost all the journalists have been let go?"""

Bannon blasts Netanyahu for dragging US toward potential war with IranFormer top Trump advisor and key MAGA voice, accuses hawkish Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of sabotaging previous negotiations over Iran's nuclear deal to push his own agenda.","Former Trump strategist and a key voice in the Make America Great Again (MAGA) orbit, Steve Bannon, has delivered a scathing broadside against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, questioning whether Israel was dictating American foreign policy as President Donald Trump weighs military action against Iran.

""Who in the hell are you to lecture the American people?"" Bannon said on his widely followed War Room podcast, referring to Netanyahu.""Who are you to lecture the American people? The American people are not going to tolerate it. Not going to put up with it.""

Bannon, an influential voice in the American right, who served as chief strategist during Donald Trump's first administration, was seen entering the White House on Thursday morning for a reported lunch with the president.

He has emerged as one of the loudest critics of US support for Israel's military campaign, which has escalated alongside fears that Trump may green-light direct strikes on Iran.

Alongside right-wing firebrands like Tucker Carlson, Bannon has warned that Trump risks shattering the ""America First"" base that helped power his rise and could lose the presidency if he’s seen as starting a new Middle East war.

""President Trump may come to that conclusion, but it's not something he would just say… 'Oh yeah, let's go bomb ‘em and take care of it.' He's going to do it because he's got to weigh the options now that you've gotten us into it,"" Bannon said.

""Quit coming to us to finish it,"" he added, directing his remarks squarely at Netanyahu.

'We just got out of 20 years of it'

Bannon accused the Israeli prime minister of sabotaging previous negotiations over Iran's nuclear deal to push his own agenda of ""regime change and regime destruction.""

""That's what he was pitching the other night,"" Bannon said.

""That's exactly where we are, and people should be truthful with each other, particularly in these tough decisions. That's what allies do. Allies don't manipulate and don't inextricably draw people into situations from which the other party has to get them out of.""

Netanyahu has defended his stance, warning MAGA-aligned critics of intervention:

""Today, it's Tel Aviv. Tomorrow, it's New York... I understand 'America First.' I don't understand 'America Dead.'""

But that message has sparked deep divisions inside Trump's base and fury from key voices on the right who see the war as political suicide.

""It's just propaganda, propaganda, propaganda and Lindsey Graham, Lindsey Graham, Lindsey Graham,"" Bannon fumed, referring to the pro-war senator from South Carolina.

Before Israel launched its aggression, Bannon said he urged Netanyahu to ""read the room"" and rethink his threats.

""It's gonna drag us into a regional war,"" Bannon said.

""We just got out of 20 years of it….but…if they go it alone, it's the end of the American relationship with Israel. It's just the end of it."""
6/19/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/0615b47b479a,"What happens if the US attacks Iran? Experts warn of regional firestormWhile the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are often cited as cautionary tales against further American military interventions, momentum in the West appears to be shifting towards another major escalation in the Middle East.","US media outlets are increasingly filled with stories and op-ed columns drawing comparisons to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, hailing “a dazzling series of victories” by Israel. These narratives often portray Israel, a small state, as having launched “brilliant” attacks on Iran, a country of 92 million, targeting its top leadership and nuclear scientists.

In the context of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu government's genocidal campaign in Gaza, these Israeli strikes are framed by much of the Western media as a courageous war cry in a righteous battle against a so-called evil regime in Tehran.

Yet Israel, unlike other states in the region, has nuclear weapons, receives state-of-the-art weaponry from Washington, and is shielded by sophisticated American air defences. Should the US formally enter this ongoing war, the consequences could be far more destabilising than many in the West anticipate.

“A potential US entry into the Israel-Iran war would mark a pivotal turning point—not just for the trajectory of the conflict, but for the entire Middle East and international order,” which could fundamentally reshape the Muslim-Arab majority region, says Andreas Krieg, associate professor at King's College London and director of MENA Analytica.

“It would embolden hardline actors across the region and possibly fracture the nascent détente that the Gulf states have been trying to build with Iran,” he tells TRT World, suggesting it could force key platers—especially Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Oman— to choose sides.

Krieg adds that US involvement could derail ongoing Gulf-led diplomatic efforts, particularly the Qatar-Oman initiative aimed at reviving nuclear negotiations.

If the US were to intervene, Iran’s weakened regional allies in its Axis of Resistance, a coalition of Shia forces from Lebanon’s Hezbollah, Yemen’s Houthis, and Iraq’s Kata’ib Hezbollah, might be reactivated in a desperate bid to stretch US capacity across multiple fronts.

“What began as a shadow war is evolving into a protracted, multi-domain confrontation with no clear exit—but with immense risks of regional implosion,” he adds.

Though Iran is currently fending off Israeli attacks, direct US involvement could cause Tehran to gradually lose ground, says Sergei Markov, a leading Russian political analyst and former advisor to President Vladimir Putin. He argues that Israeli strikes so far appear more effective than Iran’s responses.

Still, Markov notes that much uncertainty surrounds the conflict, not least because of the improbability of a US ground invasion and the unpredictable reaction of Iranian society. “Some parts of the Iranian population have radical views and are ready to fight,” Markov tells TRT World.

Stability or more tension?

Matthew Bryza, a former US diplomat and senior official in President George W. Bush's administration during the Iraq War, doubts that President Trump would order a full-scale ground invasion of Iran. He reminds us that the American public has little appetite for new foreign interventions.

Instead, Bryza envisions a more limited operation: targeted strikes on Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility using bunker-busters bombs, paired with continued logistical support for Israeli air campaigns. Trump “hopes” that after such attacks, “the war would be over,” he explains.

“If Israel and the US together were able to destroy Iran’s nuclear weapons capabilities and prospects in the future, we would see a more stable Middle East with a lower risk of nuclear catastrophe,” Bryza tells TRT World.

But not all experts share this optimism. Nuclear analysts warn that bombing Fordow alone might not substantially delay Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Thousands of Iranian scientists could continue advancing the program, despite setbacks.

“Military action is unlikely to be so definitive,” wrote James Acton, a director of the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in a recent New York Times piece.

If the US and Israel continue down the military path, hoping to trigger regime change in Tehran or spark a popular uprising, they risk provoking the opposite: a prolonged and messy war with no guarantee of political transformation.

So, what happens if military operations fail to bring down the Iranian leadership?

“Short of a new Iranian revolution, we will see enormous tension after such possible US-Israel strikes,” says Bryza. “If the current clerical regime remains in Tehran,” it can take measures like blocking the strategic Strait of Hormuz and resorting to hybrid attacks on US and Israeli targets in the Middle East.

If such escalations lead to Iranian attacks on US military bases, Washington could be drawn into deeper involvement, a move Bryza describes as a “huge mistake,” potentially entangling the US in another full-scale Middle East war.

Krieg concurs that surrender or disarmament is unlikely. “The Islamic Republic’s core identity is shaped by resistance and survival under siege,” he says. “If it perceives an existential threat, the regime may escalate drastically—including asymmetric attacks on US forces, strikes on Gulf energy infrastructure,” he says, adding that “Iran’s leadership understands that national collapse would unleash chaos, and they would rather escalate than submit.”

People attend a funeral for those killed in Israeli strikes on Iran, in Qazvin.

Short of deploying weapons of mass destruction, Bryza believes the US and Israel cannot force Iran into “unconditional surrender.”

In a world already rattled by war in Ukraine and Gaza, a new conflict in Iran would have far-reaching effects. Krieg warns that a US-led strike could trigger a global oil shock, especially if Iran attempts to blockade the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20 percent of the world’s oil supply passes.

“Financial markets would be rattled by geopolitical instability. A wider war could disrupt global supply chains and empower revisionist actors—Russia and China—in their respective spheres of influence,” says Krieg.

Domestically, Trump’s Iran war ambitions are also sowing discord within his own MAGA base. Pro-Trump figures like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson have publicly questioned the wisdom of war with Iran, revealing a rift between pro-Zionist interventionists and anti-war conservatives.

Beyond strengthening US rivals like China and Russia, “such a conflict would undermine Trump’s ‘America First’ vision,” says Krieg, “pulling the US into another Middle Eastern quagmire and weakening its position in the Indo-Pacific.”

Bryza echoes this concern. A war with Iran could provoke a severe political backlash among Trump’s supporters, many of whom are staunchly anti-interventionist, which could cause a political liability for both Trump and the Republican Party, he says.

Still, Trump may not be deterred. Knowing he cannot run for a third term, he may believe his base will follow him regardless. But if an Iranian missile strike were to kill over a hundred American soldiers at a US base, warns Markov, it could ignite a major public backlash, one that even Trump may not be able to contain."
6/19/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/553d30f129c2,"China warns of ‘nightmare scenario’ if Iranian government forced to collapseChinese analysts say regime change in Tehran — an outcome many believe Israel ultimately seeks — would trigger regional chaos, disrupt vital energy supplies, and jeopardise Beijing’s extensive interests in the Middle East.","As the Israel-Iran conflict intensifies with the US President Donald Trump demanding Tehran’s ‘unconditional surrender’ and issuing stark threats against Iran’s leadership, China has stepped up its diplomatic efforts – condemning Tel Aviv’s military strikes and Washington’s escalating rhetoric, and warning of grave consequences if the violence spirals into a wider regional war.

Chinese experts say a collapse of government in Tehran — an outcome many believe Israel, and even the US, ultimately seeks — would trigger regional chaos, disrupt vital energy supplies, and jeopardise Beijing’s extensive interests in the Middle East.

In a video interview with TRT World, Einar Tangen, senior fellow at the Beijing-based Taihe Institute and founder of Asia Narratives, described the prospect of the Iranian government’s fall as a “nightmare scenario” for Beijing.

“Forty-five percent of China’s oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz,” Tangen said. “Regional chaos and disrupted oil flows would have a huge impact on China’s energy lifeline and strategic interests. Beyond that, it would create a massive power vacuum and threaten China’s Belt and Road investments across the region.”

China purchases about 90 percent of Iran’s oil exports. In March, Iranian oil made up 16 percent of China’s seaborne crude imports, according to Kpler data as reported by Reuters.

Jian Gao, a professor at Shanghai International Studies University, and visiting fellow of China Forum at Center for International Strategy and Security Studies at Tsinghua University echoed this alarm, describing Israel’s initial attack on Iran as “a very obvious invasion of sovereignty.”

“This is absolutely a very serious violation of the United Nations Charter. There is a large possibility this kind of attack could escalate into a large-scale or full-scale war in the very near future — this is not what China wishes to see,” he told TRT World.

China intensifies diplomatic push, condemns Israeli attacks

Tangen’s and Gao’s remarks come as Beijing has repeatedly denounced Israel’s actions in its official remarks. China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking to both his Israeli and Iranian counterparts last week, called Israel’s attacks a violation of international law and warned they could plunge the Middle East into deeper turmoil.

“China clearly opposes Israel’s attack on Iran with military force in violation of international law,” Wang told Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar. “The urgent task is to immediately take measures to avoid escalation and return to diplomacy.”

In a call with Iran’s foreign minister, Wang went further, condemning Israel for violating Iran’s sovereignty and warning of the dangerous precedent set by targeting nuclear facilities.

Jianlu Bi, a Beijing-based current affairs commentator, told TRT World that China has been consistent in opposing actions that exacerbate the conflict.

“From the outset, Beijing has voiced profound concern over the escalating tensions, opposing any infringement on Iran’s sovereignty and calling for immediate measures to ‘put the brakes on’ the conflict and cool down the tension.”

Beijing has also moved to protect its citizens, evacuating hundreds from both Iran and Israel amid mounting security risks.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Wednesday said China has evacuated 791 citizens from Iran “with the support of neighbouring countries” and is relocating over 1,000 more. He noted that Chinese embassies, including those in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, are assisting at border crossings, and some nationals have already been safely evacuated from Israel.

Limited options, but growing alarm

While China has condemned the attacks and called for restraint, Tangen noted that Beijing is unlikely to move beyond diplomatic engagement for now, even if the US decides to join Israel in attacking Iran.

“China will see a US-Israel strike on Iran as reckless escalation — a dangerous violation of the UN Charter,” Tangen said. “But China does not want direct confrontation with the US. It will stick to urging de-escalation, seeking to project itself as a responsible global power.”

Gao highlighted the complexities. “The contradictions between Israel and Iran are in a kind of deadlock. A chaotic situation in the Middle East is not in the interest of the American side either. Maybe it serves Israel’s immediate interests, but the US and Israel don’t have identical interests in the region.”

Both Tangen and Gao warned of red lines, particularly concerning attacks on nuclear sites and civilian infrastructure, with Gao cautioning that bringing a deliberate change in the government of Iran is an unrealistic goal.

“It’s impossible to cultivate a pro-West or pro-America government in Iran. What happened in Afghanistan is not a faraway story. If the US remains addicted to regime change, it risks another serious lesson,” Gao said.

BRI and the broader stakes

The escalating war threatens China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) ambitions in the region. Tangen pointed out that while the BRI consists of multiple corridors, conflict in the Middle East could deal a severe setback to China’s westward trade plans.

“This might be playing into Washington’s strategy to disrupt the BRI,” Tangen said, contrasting Beijing’s emphasis on development with what he described as the US spreading “war and arms.”

Bi added that China’s calls for restraint and dialogue stem from both principle and pragmatism. “China’s position reflects its consistent foreign policy principles of non-interference and peaceful resolution, but also a hard-headed assessment of its national interests. Instability in the region directly impacts global energy markets and supply chains vital for China’s economic development.”

China has positioned itself as a likely mediator in global conflicts, leveraging its success in brokering the Saudi-Iran rapprochement in March 2023. Wang Yi has offered China’s help in facilitating dialogue between the two sides, stressing that “force cannot bring lasting peace.”

Tangen affirmed Beijing’s outreach efforts to all sides but cautioned that with the US and Israel intent on toppling the Iranian government, meaningful progress toward peace may be elusive.

Bi emphasised that now is the time for “sustained and vigorous multilateral diplomacy.”

“The current trajectory of the conflict is unsustainable. All international actors must exert maximum pressure on both Israel and Iran to de-escalate. Robust behind-the-scenes negotiations and a firm rejection of violence as a political tool are essential,” he stressed.

Gao underlined China’s stance: “China is not going to pick sides but will provide a platform for peace negotiation between different powers. What we’ve seen from China in the past years is exactly this kind of constructive engagement.”

Responding to speculation that China might use the crisis as cover for action on Taiwan, Tangen dismissed the idea, noting that Beijing’s position remains unchanged.

Tangen said Taiwan is not a pressing focus for China beyond concerns about US efforts to arm it with offensive weapons. He emphasised that Taiwan’s economy is deeply tied to the Chinese mainland, and China has no interest in forced reunification.

“However, any move toward independence or deployment of missiles capable of striking Beijing would cross a very deep red line, prompting a swift Chinese response,” he added, accusing the US of provoking tensions globally while blaming others.

“The United States — or more precisely, President Donald Trump — has no endgame, leaving the rest of the world to act as the adults in the room and wait for this reckless, childish behaviour to run its course.”"

A senior White House official told WSJ that multiple options remain on the table, and that Trump would continue to watch how the Israelis operate.

Pentagon prepares, but diplomacy remains an option

To date, the US military's role has been limited to supporting Israel's defence against Iranian ballistic missiles and drones.

Pentagon officials have confirmed that no definitive order has been issued for direct US involvement.

The US Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs Chairman attended a White House meeting on Wednesday, following a congressional hearing.

While strike planning is under way, sources told WSJ that Trump may still prefer to resolve the crisis diplomatically.

The Iranian government has rejected any negotiations under military pressure.

""Iran does NOT negotiate under duress, shall NOT accept peace under duress, and certainly NOT with a has-been warmonger clinging to relevance,"" Iran's UN Mission said in a statement, in an apparent reference to Trump.

A possible target is Iran's Fordow uranium enrichment facility, situated deep beneath a mountain.

As yet, Israel hasn't struck the site, widely thought impervious to conventional munitions.

The United States is the only country known to possess 30,000-pound (around 13.5 tonnes) bunker-buster bombs capable of destroying the site."
6/18/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/2cee7ba89e12,From Palestine to Iran: Is India’s Middle East policy shifting under Modi?New Delhi’s abstention on the UN Gaza ceasefire vote and its distancing from the SCO statement on Israel’s strikes in Iran have drawn criticism at home and raised questions abroad.,"India’s recent decisions on two major flashpoints in the Middle East have ignited a debate over whether New Delhi is abandoning its long-held policy of non-alignment and support for dialogue-based conflict resolution.

New Delhi abstained from a United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) vote calling for a Gaza ceasefire and distancing itself from a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) statement condemning Israel’s military strikes against Iran.

These positions have drawn sharp criticism from opposition parties at home, while also raising questions abroad about India’s balancing act in an increasingly polarised global order, especially as it aspires to be a leading voice of the Global South and a key player in multilateral platforms like BRICS and the SCO.

A departure from traditional stance?

India, once a steadfast advocate for Palestinian statehood and a vocal supporter of peace efforts in West Asia, has found itself on the defensive after choosing to abstain on the latest UNGA resolution calling for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Gaza.

The resolution, introduced by Spain, passed overwhelmingly with 149 votes in favour, 12 against, and 19 abstentions — India among them.

Critics argue that this marks a stark departure from India’s vote just six months earlier when it supported a similar call for a ceasefire. The principal opposition party, the Congress, led the charge, accusing the Modi government of eroding India’s moral standing.

“India’s foreign policy is in a shambles,” said Mallikarjun Kharge, president of India’s main opposition Congress party, questioning whether India had “abandoned its principled stand advocating for ceasefire, peace and dialogue in West Asia.”

His colleague Priyanka Gandhi Vadra – a scion of the Nehru-Gandhi family – echoed the sentiment, saying that India’s abstention had left the country “virtually isolated” on the world stage.

Similarly, India’s decision not to associate itself with an SCO statement that strongly condemned Israel’s strikes on Iran and affirmed Iran’s sovereignty has further fueled the perception that New Delhi is moving away from its non-aligned roots.

Balancing act or tilt?

India’s External Affairs Ministry has argued that these decisions are consistent with a policy of advocating dialogue and diplomacy while avoiding one-sided resolutions that, in New Delhi’s view, fail to account for the complexities on the ground.

Speaking to TRT World, former Secretary in India’s Ministry of External Affairs, Anil Wadhwa, offered insights into New Delhi’s rationale.

“India supports a ceasefire in Gaza but not if the resolution in the UNGA contains language that condemns Israel in no uncertain terms without balancing sentences or clauses,” Wadhwa explained. “Sometimes it is possible for the drafters to achieve a balanced resolution in order to garner more votes.”.

On the SCO statement, Wadhwa pointed out that India was not part of the discussions and had concerns about the content.

“The language in the SCO statement completely fails to mention the IAEA resolution on Iran’s enrichment programme and its findings. It is also devoid of any indication of Iran’s adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which it has joined, or respecting the IAEA’s concerns regarding stockpiling of refined nuclear material,” he noted

Such nuanced positions, however, have left India open to allegations of leaning toward Israel, driven by deepening defence ties, economic considerations, and ongoing arms exports. Wadhwa rejected the idea that India was abandoning its traditional friendships, particularly with Iran.

“India’s stance is based on balancing its interests but at the same time ensuring that the resolutions passed or decisions taken in international fora are balanced and not one-sided,” he said.

Views from the SCO: Differing diplomatic styles

Former Kyrgyzstan Prime Minister Djoomart Otorbaev cautioned against overstating any perceived divisions within the SCO over the Israel-Iran conflict and India’s position.

“Recent ‘sensational’ reports suggesting a major rift within the SCO regarding the Israeli-Iranian military conflict are premature,” Otorbaev told TRT World.

“India has released its statement on the conflict, somewhat milder than the SCO’s, but such minor differences in tone should not be misconstrued as fractures in the organisation.”

He highlighted the importance of seeing India’s approach as part of its broader diplomatic strategy.

“India continues to engage in ongoing dialogue with both Iran and Israel. External Affairs Minister Jaishankar’s discussions with his counterparts reflect the global community’s deep concern regarding rising tensions,” Otorbaev explained.

He further emphasised the shared strategic interests binding India and many SCO members, especially in Central Asia.

“India’s interests align well with most SCO countries, particularly its strong ties with Iran, which offers critical access to Central Asia. Initiatives like the North-South Strategic Transport Corridor (NSTC) exemplify this collaboration, with India investing significantly in infrastructure such as the Chabahar Port,” he noted.

In his assessment, “While India’s position on this conflict is more diplomatic and nuanced, it mirrors the stances of many countries in the Global South. The SCO will continue evolving, advocating peaceful development that benefits all member states.”

Implications for Iran ties and Global South leadership

Iran has historically been a key partner for India, from energy security to connectivity projects like the Chabahar Port. Some analysts fear that India’s recent stances could create friction in that relationship. But Wadhwa believes the ties are resilient.

“Iran is aware of India’s stance on the enrichment issue. This is not the first time that it has voted the way it did in the IAEA. Every time a vote takes place, India has explained its position clearly,” Wadhwa said.

On the broader question of India’s aspirations to be a bridge between the Global South and major powers, the abstention at the UNGA has raised eyebrows.

While most of the Global South, including key BRICS and SCO partners, backed the Gaza ceasefire resolution, India joined a small group of abstainers that included Timor-Leste, Paraguay, and Argentina.

Could this erode India’s credibility as a vocal member of the Global South? Wadhwa dismissed such concerns.

“India’s aspirations as a leader of the Global South will continue. India’s stance is also known within BRICS. Within the SCO, India has an independent voice and is not a follower of China or Russia,” he emphasised.

The fallout from India’s decisions could be felt within groupings like BRICS and the SCO, where unity on global issues has been a point of strength. India’s reluctance to sign on to collective statements could complicate efforts to present a unified front on international law, sovereignty, and conflict resolution.

Experts like Otorbaev underscore that while unity is prized, the SCO respects the sovereignty and independent diplomatic choices of its members. This nuanced dynamic may be tested, but is unlikely to unravel the organisation’s core cohesion.

India’s Middle East policy — long admired for its ability to engage all sides — now faces its sternest test, according to analysts As the region becomes a flashpoint in global rivalries, New Delhi’s effort to walk the tightrope between its strategic, economic, and moral imperatives is becoming ever more challenging, they say."
6/17/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/25b99ee226e7,"Iran-Israel standoff: Is the Mideast nearing a point of no return?As Israel escalates attacks on Iran, analysts warn of a potential regional catastrophe, especially given that Israel has nuclear weapons, unless diplomacy prevails.","Prominent analysts, including former Israeli officials, have long cautioned Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, about launching wars from Gaza to Lebanon without a defined endgame.

Now, with international opposition mounting against Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza, the country has turned its focus to Iran, “the last enemy standing,” as one expert described it to The Wall Street Journal.

Yet, many experts interpret the ongoing Israeli assault whose potential success depends more on direct American involvement than on any coherent long-term planning from Netanyahu’s government.

“A pendulum is swinging from one side to another,” says Kadir Temiz, President of ORSAM and a faculty member at Istanbul Medeniyet University.

Temiz says that in reference to the oscillation between diplomatic engagement over Iran’s nuclear programme and the regime change agenda pushed by Netanyahu and his allies in Israel, the US, and the broader West.

Netanyahu has made statements about the lack of a definitive plan ranging from dismantling Iran’s nuclear and missile capabilities to outright regime change in Tehran.

Both goals appear far-fetched and distant without explicit US support. Some influential voices in American right-wing circles, such as Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, remain fiercely opposed to another US-led war in the Middle East.

“There are clear concerns that the current Iranian regime has no clear alternative,” Temiz tells TRT World, adding that “the regime change could plunge a nation of 92 million, rich in oil and gas, into chaos and many unknowns.”

According to Ghoncheh Tazmini, an Iranian-Canadian political analyst, “Topple the government for the MKO or Pahlavi puppet – not all the population of Iran wants that.”

Tazmini refers to the MKO or Mujahadeen-e-Khalq Organisation and Reza Pahlavi, an exiled royal and vocal supporter of Israel, both of whom have called for regime change in Iran. Pahlavi has urged Iranians to rise up against the current government. The MKO lost public credibility after aligning with Saddam Hussein during the 1980s brutal Iran-Iraq war.

Will diplomacy win out?

A diplomatic resolution may be the most rational path forward, says Temiz, given the risks of destabilisation that regime change would entail.

“Not many political actors are willing to invest in this Israeli agenda,” he adds. “I believe that there will be some diplomacy with the regional Arab monarchies stepping in,” Tazmini tells TRT World.

Recent reports suggest that some lowkey Arab diplomats are conveying Iranian messages to their American interlocutors that Tehran is willing to re-engage with the US for nuclear negotiations.

More than 20 Arab and Muslim countries – including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Türkiye, all with strategic ties to the US and the Western alliance – have condemned Israeli attacks on Iran in a joint statement.

Still, tensions remain high.

US President Donald Trump’s abrupt departure from the G7 meeting in Canada, which called a vague ceasefire to Israel-Iran confrontation while placing primary blame on Tehran, and asserting that something “much bigger” than a truce is in the works, has added fuel to the speculation that Washington may be preparing its own strike.

Before leaving, Trump posted (emphasising in all caps America, first, great, and Iran’s denial of nuclear weapons) on Truth Social: “Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!”

He followed up with a declaration that added new meaning to his signature slogan: “America first means many great things, including the fact that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Make America great again!!!”

The final G7 statement, published only after Trump threatened to withhold his signature, reaffirmed Israel’s right to defend itself and described Iran as “the principal source of regional instability and terror,” reiterating that Tehran must never possess nuclear weapons.

While Iran has used its proxies, Hezbollah and other Shia groups, to expand its regional influence, many critics view Israel, as the occupying power in Palestine, as a perpetrator of war crimes and even genocide.

Iran has used its proxies, Hezbollah and other Shia groups, to expand its regional influence across the Middle East.

“The Iranian nation is not being ‘liberated’ by a genocidal regime,” Tazmini tells TRT World. “The killings have a rally-around-the-flag effect.”

Western media outlets have corroborated her claims with on-the-ground reporting.

Can a fatwa halt nuclear drive?

“I sense that a moment of critical decision on Iran is approaching,” Temiz says.

But rather than escalation, he believes that a scaled-down Iranian nuclear programme would be preferable for Israel, the US, and regional actors.

Temiz draws attention to a potentially overlooked and interesting aspect of the situation: the issuance of a clear fatwa by Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, against nuclear weapons, which can bring clarity to the lingering issue between the West and Tehran once and for all.

Khamenei has previously issued statements calling weapons of mass destruction “a serious threat to humanity,” declaring their use haram (forbidden) and insisting that protecting mankind from such threats is a universal duty.

In a 2012 interview, former Iranian president and nuclear negotiator Hassan Rouhani said that Khamenei “has issued a fatwa” against acquiring a nuclear bomb.

“If Khamenei issues a clear fatwa against the production of nuclear weapons, the view that the current Iranian regime is sustainable might prevail across both the region and globe,” Temiz says. “If this happens, it might normalise the Iranian regime as a regional and global consensus emerges to rather keep it than let it be ousted.”

Iran’s endgame: War of attrition?

While analysts widely differ on forecast outcomes, many agree that Iran’s strategy will depend on domestic support and its ability to withstand economic and military pressure.

In that context, the big question remains: how long can Iran retaliate against Israel?

“I’ve given up predicting outcomes,” says Edward Erickson, a leading American military analyst and academic. “But it seems to me that a nation of 92 million people can wage a war of attrition and fight to exhaustion against a nation of 10 million (which is already engaged up to its eyeballs in Gaza, the West Bank, and the Lebanon frontier, as well as being fully dependent on American goodwill and support).”

Erickson warns against underestimating Iran’s resilience, adding that its large population could sustain a war of attrition against Israel and potentially exhaust its systems, with support from Russia and China likely if the conflict drags on.

He adds: “Continuous stress on Israeli systems and the Israeli people can induce exhaustion”.

He believes that, should Iran opt for a prolonged conflict, both Russia and China are likely to increase their support for Tehran. Moscow has already offered to mediate, and Beijing has condemned Israel’s actions.

“The media is increasingly talking about regime collapse. I hope that will happen, but Iran surprised the world from 1980 to 1988 by conducting a long attritional war against Iraq. They may prove more resilient than the experts and pundits think,” he adds.

Tazmini agrees, referencing Iran’s resilience during the Iran-Iraq War.

However, Tehran has faced significant setbacks in Syria and Lebanon, where its influence has significantly diminished, and where Western sanctions continue to hit the Iranian economy hard.

Despite these setbacks, Iranian strikes deep inside Israel show that Tehran can “inflict heavy damage and expose Israeli vulnerability,” according to Tazmini.

Iran has recently hit Israeli refineries and energy assets among other targets. Temiz says that Iran has the capacity to respond.

“But the problem is no one can afford the costs that would arise if Iran uses its capacity to the full extent against Israel, a Jewish state. Because of that, a big diplomacy is underway round the clock,” he says.

According to Erickson, “without a ground invasion like the US occupation of Iraq, nobody can stop Iran from actually building a bomb right now.” While Iranians were surprised by Israel's Thursday attack in the middle of nuclear deal negotiations with the US, they've certainly been planning to disperse assets for years, he says.

If Iran moves toward weaponisation, would it risk a scenario akin to Japan in WWII?

“That is a scenario. But a very far-fetched one,” says Tazmini. “But many worst-case scenarios have happened under Netanyahu,” she notes, especially now with strong backing from Trump in the confrontation with Iran.

“What is the precedent they would set here if this were a scenario that happened?” she asks. “So, then it will be Russia’s turn,” she warns, suggesting that global politics could slide into “law of the jungle.”

Dan Steinbock, an international economist and author of The Fall of Israel, cites a 2023 US war game involving senior officials, bipartisan lawmakers, and experts. The simulation concluded with Israel launching 50 nuclear strikes on 25 major Iranian military targets in response to Tehran’s escalating resistance.

“It appears, the Trump administration and the Netanyahu cabinet are jointly engaged in a massive, pre-calculated regime change operation that seeks to eliminate entire Iranian political, economic and military capabilities – regardless of the devastating consequences for the region and the world,” he says."
6/26/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/9cb12c62443e,No invasion or rebellion — Experts question legality of Trump's troop deployment in Los AngelesConstitution and legal experts suggest that US President Donald Trump may have violated the Posse Comitatus Act by dispatching troops to the American city affected by protests.,"Washington, DC — What began as a regular immigration sweep in several parts of Los Angeles in the US state of California quickly turned to a violent confrontation between immigration authorities and the demonstrators protesting their action.

President Donald Trump immediately deployed thousands of National Guard troops, and later Marines, to Los Angeles, throwing the second-largest American city into turmoil.

Since then, US Marines and National Guard have detained people, and Trump has ordered the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to expand immigration raids to Democratic-controlled cities, signalling a potential repetition of the turmoil in Los Angeles.

Conflicting rulings have been issued by a federal court and an appeals court in this case.

Both California's Governor, Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass have pushed back against the use of the military in LA and accused the president of ""illegal militarisation of Los Angeles.""

Experts say Newsom and Bass may not be wrong.

Mark Graber, Regents Professor at the University of Maryland School of Law, told TRT World that the president's deployment of National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles is ""probably illegal.""

""The president can deploy only in the case of an invasion or a rebellion, where there is an attempt to overthrow the government and the local government is no longer able to enforce the law,"" Graber told TRT World.

""Neither is the case in Los Angeles.""

Jacqueline Stevens, a Political Scientist and Deportation Law expert, also said that the action exceeds Trump’s power as president.

“Unlike constitutions that provide extensive ‘emergency’ powers to a national leader, the United States Constitution specifically constrains the powers of the federal government, as enumerated in the Tenth Amendment ‘The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people,’” Stevens told TRT World.

The Posse Comitatus Act

Generally, a president is allowed to deploy troops to a state in two cases.

The first case is upon the state's request, where the state's legislature or governor officially requests the deployment from the White House.

Even Trump himself pointed to this fact in 2020 in an interview with ABC News.

""We can't call in the National Guard unless we're requested by a governor,"" Trump said at the time.

In the second case, under the Insurrection Act of 1807, the president can deploy troops without the state's request when there is an invasion or rebellion, or when there is unlawful activity that deprives citizens of their constitutional rights and the state is unable or unwilling to protect them.

In his memorandum, Trump didn't invoke the Insurrection Act. Instead, he relied on 10 U.S.C. 12406, a law enacted in 1903 that allows the president to call up the National Guard if there is ""a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States"".

Experts argued that this doesn't apply to the situation in Los Angeles, since the protests don't represent a rebellion or invasion.

Moreover, there was no request by California to the White House to deploy troops.

By doing so, experts say Trump has violated a law called The Posse Comitatus Act, under which the military can only be used for a domestic purpose when authorised by the law.

Frank Ravitch, a Professor of Law & Walter H. Stowers Chair in Law & Religion at Michigan State University, told TRT World that whether the deployment is constitutional or not, it is ""likely illegal.""

""The President has relied on a legal provision that allows the use of the military to quell a rebellion, but the protests are not even close to a rebellion, so even if constitutional, the President's actions are illegal as a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act,"" Ravitch, who is also an author, told TRT World.

""The only other basis to use troops domestically is the Insurrection Act, and the provisions of that have not been met, and the President has not invoked it,"" he added.

""His best argument would be that the National Guard is only being used to protect federal personnel and property, but even then, the power to do so is limited.""

Ravitch said that the last time a President used the National Guard without approval of state officials was in 1965 to protect protesters opposing segregation in the South from violence.

""What Trump is doing is a far cry from that,"" he said.

Sanford Levinson, who teaches constitutional law and legal history at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, told TRT World that Trump is acting ""like a would-be dictator.""

He said while he hopes Trump's actions will be found illegal in courts, the US system gives presidents a ""great deal of discretion.""

""We often count on Congress to rein in presidents, but the current majority in Congress has adopted an American equivalent of the Führerprinzip, that is, personal loyalty to Donald J. Trump rather than genuine fidelity to the Constitution itself,"" Levinson told TRT World.

The Fuhrerprinzip, or Leader Principle, was a fundamental element of Nazi Germany, where the leader of the country had absolute authority.

With no such case being applicable to the unrest in Los Angeles, Newsom has filed a lawsuit to challenge the military involvement.

In his complaint, Newsom didn't challenge the use of 12406 as a standalone authority, but cited the violation of the Posse Comitatus Act.

""President Trump's Memo purporting to call into federal service members of the California National Guard under 10 U.S.C. 12406 without issuing this order through Governor Newsom is contrary to law and outside of the authority granted to the President under that statute,"" the complaint said.

""Violation of the Posse Comitatus Act is imminent, if not already underway.""

Experts agree with the complaint, saying that the lawsuit could have a legal ground under both the Constitution and the Posse Comitatus Act.

""This can be challenged in courts under both the Constitution and the Posse Comitatus Act,"" Ravitch said.

""Both protestors, directly impacted, and the state may be able to challenge the military call-up."""
6/15/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/4189dc580d3f,"Away from the Iran spotlight, Israel continues to kill, maim Palestinians in GazaWhile the headlines shifted toward Israel’s confrontation with Iran, Gaza continues to bleed.","As the global spotlight shifts to the rising military exchanges between Israel and Iran, Palestinians in Gaza continue to face new waves of bombardment, starvation, and death.

Millions of Palestinians in Gaza faced relentless Israeli attacks even as prospects of a ceasefire faded amid Tel Aviv’s opening of the Iran front that has seen both sides trade missile and drone strikes since Friday morning.

The developments ran contrary to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s public acknowledgement of a potential opening for a ceasefire and hostage release deal—possibly tied to a US-proposed 60-day truce.

Netanyahu claimed readiness to proceed with negotiations, but his government simultaneously intensified strikes across Gaza and the occupied West Bank.

At least 42 Palestinians were killed in a single day on June 14, many of them while waiting for food near aid distribution sites.

In total, more than 100 people have reportedly been killed at food lines since late May, painting a dire picture of the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe.

Death while seeking aid across Gaza

The last four days saw dozens of Palestinians killed as they gathered near aid points in Gaza City, Rafah, Khan Younis, and Beit Lahia.

On June 14 alone, Israeli fire killed 27 aid-seekers, and Gaza’s civil defence agency later reported 41 dead—more than half while queuing for food.

“Forty-one people were martyred due to the ongoing Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip, 23 of whom were waiting for aid,” Mohammad al-Mughayyir, an official from the agency, told AFP.

The attacks targeted tents, mosques, and makeshift shelters where displaced civilians had sought refuge.

On June 15, five more people were gunned down near food lines in central and southern Gaza, including at US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation sites.

Critics accuse the foundation of facilitating forced displacement while failing to provide access to aid. The UN and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.

""GHF, I think it's fair to say, has been, from a principled humanitarian standpoint, a failure,"" Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, told a press briefing in Geneva.

""They are not doing what a humanitarian operation should do, which is providing aid to people where they are, in a safe and secure manner,” he added.

Meanwhile, Egyptian authorities blocked a Global March to Gaza organised by activists hoping to reach the Rafah border crossing.

Several were detained, expelled, or denied entry as Egypt cracked down on pro-Palestine demonstrations amid growing regional solidarity.

Al Aqsa Mosque closed, homes vandalised

A three-day internet blackout, blamed on Israeli strikes, deepened Gaza’s isolation until it was lifted on Saturday.

The Palestine Red Crescent said the outage severely impeded emergency responses, further endangering civilians.

Though service had been restored by June 14, the Palestinian Telecommunications Regulatory Authority confirmed on Monday that a renewed internet and landline outage had occurred across southern and central Gaza due to damage from Israeli attacks on communications infrastructure.

Parallel to its bombardment of Gaza, Israel escalated its repression in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.

A full lockdown was imposed across the West Bank on June 13, coinciding with Israel’s air strikes on Iran.

In the occupied East Jerusalem, Israeli police forcibly evacuated worshippers from Al Aqsa Mosque after dawn prayers and sealed its gates, marking the first closure of the compound since the COVID-19 pandemic.

In Ramallah, Israeli forces stormed Jalazone refugee camp, arrested three former prisoners, and vandalised homes.

Between June 13 to 16, Israeli strikes killed scores of Palestinians, with medics reporting at least 25 deaths on Sunday alone.

Air strikes hit residential areas, tent camps, and aid lines with indiscriminate fire.

In Khan Younis and Nuseirat, bodies piled up at overwhelmed hospitals.

Al-Awda and Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospitals received dozens of victims, many of them children and the elderly.

On Monday, Israeli forces intensified attacks across Gaza, killing and injuring dozens of Palestinians, including children, in renewed assaults by land, air, and sea, Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.

Medical sources confirmed the killing of two Palestinian fishermen and the disappearance of a third after Israeli naval forces opened fire on their boat off the coast of Gaza City.

In southern Gaza, three Palestinians were killed and at least 20 others injured while waiting for humanitarian aid near the Al-Alam area west of Rafah, where Israeli forces have previously targeted civilians gathering for food assistance.

Now into its 619th day, Israel's genocide in Gaza has claimed over 55,300 deaths, with fears some 11,000 remain buried under debris, according to Palestinian authorities."
6/14/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/8149d4ad88c6,"Gunman who killed Minnesota lawmaker, husband still at large as manhunt continuesPolice identify suspect, believed to still be in Midwest, as Vance Luther Boelter.","A massive manhunt entered a second day on Sunday in Minnesota for the gunman who killed a Democratic state lawmaker while posing as a police officer, a crime that Governor Tim Walz characterised as a ""politically motivated assassination"".

The suspect, whom police identified as Vance Luther Boelter, 57, fled on foot when officers confronted him at the Brooklyn Park home of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were both killed.

The gunman earlier had shot and wounded another Democratic lawmaker, state Senator John Hoffman, and his wife Yvette at their home a few kilometres away, authorities said.

Minnesota US Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat, said on Sunday morning that authorities believe the suspect is still in the Midwest, adding that an alert had been put out in neighbouring South Dakota.

""Clearly, this is politically motivated,"" she said, noting that the state's entire congressional delegation - Republicans and Democrats - issued a shared statement condemning the shootings.

The suspect left behind a vehicle outside Hortman's house in suburban Minneapolis that resembled a police SUV, including flashing lights, and contained a ""manifesto"" and a target list of other politicians and institutions, officials said.

Authorities had not publicly identified a specific motive as of Saturday evening.

Boelter has links to evangelical ministries and claimed to be a security expert with experience in Gaza and Africa, according to online postings and public records reviewed.

""There clearly was some through line with abortion, because of the groups that were on the list and other things that I've heard were in this manifesto. So that was one of his motivations,"" Klobuchar said.

Boelter had been appointed in 2016 by Walz' predecessor to a state advisory board, where he served alongside Hoffman, according to state records. Authorities said they were not certain yet whether the two had any meaningful interactions.

""There's certainly some overlap with some public meetings, I will say, with Senator Hoffman and the individual,"" Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans told reporters on Saturday. ""But we don't know the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.""

ABC News, citing law enforcement officials, reported the list of targets featured dozens of Minnesota Democrats, including Walz, who was also the Democratic vice presidential candidate last year.

The killing was the latest in a series of high-profile episodes of political violence, including the attack on former Democratic US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband in 2022, the attempted assassination of Donald Trump during last year's presidential campaign and an arson attack at Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's house in April.

Republican and Democratic politicians across the country reacted with shock and horror and issued calls to tone down increasingly heated political rhetoric.

Klobuchar said she had seen both Hortman and Hoffman at a political dinner on Friday, just hours before they were shot.

""We started out together in politics, moms with young kids, and somehow she was able to balance getting to know every door, knock on every house in her district, while raising two children - Girl Scout leader, she taught Sunday school,"" she said of Hortman, 55.

Klobuchar said both Hoffmans were ""hanging in there"" after undergoing surgery for multiple gunshot wounds.

Gunman posed as officer

The attacks started around 2 am (0700 GMT) on Saturday, when authorities said the gunman shot the Hoffmans in their home in Champlin before driving several kilometres to Hortman's home in Brooklyn Park.

Police went to the Hortman house proactively at the request of a sergeant who responded to the Hoffman attack and was concerned other politicians might be at risk. The gunman immediately fired upon the two officers when they arrived, and when they returned fire, he ran.

The FBI released photos of the suspect wearing a rubber mask and a police-like uniform.

David Carlson, 59, said he has shared a house in Minneapolis with Boelter for more than a year and last saw him on Friday night. He said he received a disturbing text from Boelter at about 6 am on Saturday.

""He said that he might be dead soon,"" said Carlson, who called police.

Police said they found flyers with ""No Kings"" printed on them in the gunman's car in reference to the thousands of nationwide ""No Kings"" protests on Saturday against the Trump administration, but that there were no known direct links between him and the movement.

""Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,"" Trump said in a statement.

Trump has faced criticism from some opponents for using inflammatory rhetoric at times when talking about his political rivals.

In one of his first moves in office earlier this year, Trump pardoned nearly everyone criminally charged with participating in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack."

Can Iran confront Israel alone?","Israel is advancing across the Middle East, launching successive attacks on its adversaries — Lebanon’s Hezbollah, Yemen’s Houthis, and, finally, Iran, the leading force of the so-called Axis of Resistance, an anti-Zionist alliance.

On June 13, Israel launched major strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, missile bases, and top officials. Prime Minister Netanyahu declared success, and said that “the strikes would continue until Israel is satisfied that the threat of Iran is gone.” Iran vowed a “powerful response”, and regional leaders braced for escalation.

While some held out hope that the Trump administration might pressure Israel to halt its campaign in Gaza and ease tensions with Iran through nuclear negotiations in Washington, the latest Israeli strike on Iranian soil signals that Netanyahu’s government has a free hand, regardless of which administration is in power in the US.

The Israeli attacks killed two of Iran’s top commanders, Major General Hossein Salami, head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and Major General Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, along with six leading nuclear scientists. Ali Shamkhani, a senior adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was also killed.

Israel also struck key targets, including the Natanz enrichment facility, suspected weaponisation research sites, and ballistic missile launch areas.

As of writing this report, Israel has launched new strikes on Tabriz Airport in northwestern Iran, suggesting that escalation is likely to continue. Netanyahu has said that Israeli operations against Iran will persist “as many days as it takes.” Some Israeli officials suggest that it could take as many as 14 days.

Iranian media shared images from Israeli attack including this one which shows a damaged home of one of the generals who was assassinated last night.

But with Iran now largely isolated from weakened allies, can it do anything in return against the US-backed Israeli state?

Iran: “Walking a strategic tightrope”

“Iran’s rapid drone retaliation and the gradual closure of regional airspace signal rising tensions, though a broader regional war remains unlikely,” says Dr Daria Daniels Skodnik, a political scientist and former Deputy Commandant at the NATO Defence College in Rome.

“It’s too early to say whether Iran’s response marks the limit of its retaliation or is simply the opening move in a longer campaign. The launch of over 100 drones toward Israel signals resolve but remains calibrated, asserting deterrence without triggering full-scale war. For now, Iran is walking a strategic tightrope — retaliating, but on its own terms,” she tells TRT World.

Although Dr Daniels acknowledges that Iran’s options are limited due to shifting regional dynamics from Syria to Lebanon and Gaza she warns that Tehran should not be underestimated by its adversaries. “Some regional states may quietly support Israel’s efforts to contain Iran, but they are equally wary of open war and will push for de-escalation,” she adds.

“Notably, key Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, have been working to stabilise the region by engaging both Tehran and Tel Aviv. Israel’s large-scale strikes risk upending that fragile diplomatic effort, forcing these actors to reassess their balancing strategies.”

Prior to the attack, Iranian and US delegations were scheduled to meet in Oman for nuclear talks on Sunday, but it’s now unclear whether the talks will proceed.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump, who just ordered the withdrawal of nonessential military and diplomatic personnel from the Middle East in anticipation of Israeli action, backed Netanyahu’s campaign, blaming Tehran for the failure to reach a nuclear deal.

“I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, adding, “The United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the world, BY FAR, and Israel has a lot of it with much more to come. And they know how to use it.”

TRT World contacted a former senior Iranian official for insight on the country’s potential response, but he declined to comment.

Can Iran hit back hard?

Sami Al-Arian, a Palestinian academic and director of the Centre for Islam and Global Affairs (CIGA) at Istanbul Zaim University, believes “Iran has the capacity to strike Israel with force using ballistic missiles and advanced drones.”

“There are no restrictions now. It’s open warfare with no ceilings,” Al-Arian tells TRT World.

Dr Daniels shares a similar perspective, describing the confrontation as “a conflict without a clearly defined off-ramp.” She emphasises that the next 48 to 72 hours will be crucial in determining whether the “confrontation evolves into a prolonged campaign or reshapes the region’s strategic landscape.”

Israel appears to have set a high objective for its attacks which is “to decapitate the regime”, according to Theo Nencini, an expert on Iranian foreign policy. He points to the high-profile deaths of key Iranian military leaders, including the top advisor of the Supreme Leader, Shamkhani, who was killed in his home, according to Iranian media sources.

A picture from Ali Shamkhani's house. Shamkhani, ex-head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, was assassinated by Israeli overnight attacks.

“Iran’s response will depend heavily on the scale of Israeli attacks, which are still ongoing,” Nencini tells TRT World.

Despite Israel’s extensive strikes, initial assessments indicate that Iran’s core nuclear capabilities, buried deep underground, may have survived. Dr Daniels says Iran’s immediate retaliation via drones reflects a measured approach.

“It’s conventional, not yet escalatory. But if Israeli operations continue, or if key nuclear assets are perceived to be irreversibly destroyed, Iran may feel it has little left to lose,” she says.

She also cautions that global politics may be entering “a dangerous phase of strategic brinkmanship between Israel and Iran, with the risk of miscalculation growing by the hour.”

Joost Hiltermann, a special adviser on MENA at the International Crisis Group, agrees that Iran must respond forcefully to avoid appearing weak at home. “If it fails to show muscle, it may lose the confidence of the Iranian public,” he says.

Still, Hiltermann stresses that regardless of Iran’s eventual response, the Israeli air campaign has already inflicted major damage on Iran’s military leadership, air defence systems, and possibly its nuclear infrastructure.

Fatima Karimkhan, a Tehran-based journalist whose neighbourhood was targeted in the overnight attacks. “Difficult time to live in. I am safe but they hit some places near my home. Mostly worry about tonight,” she says.

What else can Iran do?

Iran has several potential options against Israel: increasing uranium enrichment to weapons-grade levels, utilising regional proxies against Tel Aviv, withdrawing from nuclear talks with the US, or even blocking the Strait of Hormuz to disrupt global oil flows.

“In no circumstances will Iran negotiate the right to enrichment. That’s non-negotiable,” Karimkhan tells TRT World. “Withdrawal from the NPT, higher enrichment, and ending negotiations with the US are now openly discussed,” she says, referring to the 1968 Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), of which Iran is a signatory.

Dr Daniels sees that Iran will likely choose “to keep nuclear weapons outside the scope of this confrontation, preserving a key strategic threshold it has long been careful not to cross.”

A first nuclear test is another theoretical option, but it would be “extremely risky,” according to Nencini. “That may, in fact, be Israel’s objective: to corner the Islamic Republic of Iran and provoke it to make a mistake. This is something that is being studied in depth right now in Iran.”

Tehran could also turn to “asymmetrical retaliation”, using its Axis of Resistance proxies or launching cyberattacks But he draws attention to the poor state of pro-Iranian militias under constant pressure of Israeli attacks, which have already significantly diminished their effectiveness against Tel Aviv.

Another move could be blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital global oil route, in order to create financial panic and pressure Israel and its allies. However, Nencini sees this as unlikely.

“Blocking Hormuz would amount to seriously thwarting the vital interests of the Arab countries of the Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia, which currently maintains cordial ties with Tehran,” he says.

Additionally, such a move would “greatly upset” China, a key Iranian ally that imports around 1.5 million barrels of oil per day from Iran through Hormuz. He adds: “So, for the time being, I think blocking the Strait of Hormuz is off the table.”"

He urges restraint and stresses that dialogue and diplomacy are the only viable path to peace amid rising regional tensions.,"The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said that he is ready to travel to Iran following Israel’s attack on the country’s nuclear and military facilities.

“I wish to inform the Board that I have indicated to the respective authorities my readiness to travel at the earliest to assess the situation and ensure safety, security and non-proliferation in Iran,” Rafael Grossi said in a statement on Friday.

Saying that they are in contact with competent Iranian authorities following the attacks, he added: “At present, the competent Iranian authorities have confirmed that the Natanz enrichment site has been impacted and that there are no elevated radiation levels.""

""They have also reported that at present the Esfahan and Fordow sites have not been impacted.” Calling the unfolding developments “deeply concerning,” Grossi reiterated that nuclear facilities must never be attacked.

“Such attacks have serious implications for nuclear safety, security and safeguards, as well as regional and international peace and security,” he said.

“Despite the current military actions and heightened tensions, it is clear that the only sustainable path forward – for Iran, for Israel, the entire region, and the international community – is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability, and cooperation,” he stressed."

The attack comes as nuclear talks stall and tensions soar, with Iran vowing severe retaliation.","Israel launched a major attack on Iran, drawing their long-running shadow war into the open conflict in a way that could spiral into a wider, more dangerous regional war.

The strikes early Friday set off explosions in the capital of Tehran as Israel said it was targeting Iranian nuclear and military facilities. Iranian state media reported that the leader of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps and at least four top nuclear scientists had been killed.

Israel's attack comes as tensions have escalated over Iran’s rapidly advancing nuclear programme, which Israel sees as a threat to its existence.

The Trump administration revived efforts to negotiate limits on Iran’s uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. But the indirect talks between American and Iranian diplomats have hit a stalemate. The attack has pushed the region into a new and uncertain phase.

What do we know so far?

Israel hit nuclear sites and killed the Revolutionary Guard chief along with other senior Iranian officials. Israeli leaders said the attack was aimed at preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb as the country enriches uranium and comes close to a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.

Iran has long said its programme is peaceful, and US intelligence agencies have assessed Iran was not actively building a weapon.

In a video announcing the military attacks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes hit Iran's main enrichment site, the Natanz atomic facility, and targeted Iran's leading nuclear scientists.

He said that Israel had also targeted Iran's ballistic missile arsenal. Iranian state TV reported that the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and one of Iran's most important commanders, General Hossein Salami, had been killed. Residents of Tehran reported hearing huge explosions. Iranian state TV broadcast footage of blown-out walls, burning roofs and shattered windows in residential buildings across the capital.

It reported that blasts had set the Revolutionary Guard's headquarters ablaze.

Israel closed its airspace

Bracing for retaliation, Israel closed its airspace and said it was calling up tens of thousands of soldiers to protect the country's borders. Netanyahu claimed Friday that if Iran wasn't stopped, ""it could produce a nuclear weapon within a very short time.”

But it likely would take Iran months to build a weapon, should it choose to do so. It also hasn’t proved its ability to miniaturise a bomb to be placed atop missiles. Iranian officials have openly threatened to pursue the bomb.

Tensions over Iran's rapid nuclear advances and growing reserves of highly enriched uranium are surging seven years after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.

For the first time in two decades, the atomic watchdog agency on Thursday censured Iran for failing to comply with nuclear nonproliferation obligations meant to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.

In response, Iran said that it would open a previously undisclosed enrichment site and accelerate production of 60 percent highly enriched uranium, which could be easily processed to the 90 percent level used in nuclear weapons.

Iran's nuclear sites have long been a flash point. Iran has two main enrichment sites, Natanz, in central Isfahan province, and Fordow, near the Shiite holy city of Qom, some 90 kilometres (55 miles) southwest of Tehran. Both are designed to protect them from potential airstrikes.

Natanz is built underground on Iran’s Central Plateau, and has been targeted several times in suspected Israeli sabotage attacks, as well as by the Stuxnet virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, which destroyed Iranian centrifuges.

Fordow is buried deep inside a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries. It also hosts centrifuge cascades, but it isn’t as big a facility as Natanz.

Both sites have been the focus of the Trump administration's recent push to negotiate a new nuclear deal with Tehran.

Trump said that he warned Netanyahu against launching an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities while diplomatic efforts were underway.

US special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected to meet his Iranian counterparts in Oman for a sixth round of negotiations to start Sunday. It wasn't clear if those talks were still on.

Hours after the strikes, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei threatened Israel would face “severe punishment.""

“The powerful hand of the armed forces of the Islamic republic will not let (the attacks) go unpunished,"" the leader added in a statement posted online. Other Iranian officials echoed his warning, pledging vengeance.

State TV aired footage of Iranians chanting “Death to Israel!” and “Death to America!"" From Washington, Trump said that the US had not been involved in the attack and warned Iran against retaliating against American interests in the region."

Following a US veto of a similar push in the Security Council last week, the General Assembly adopted on Thursday the non-binding resolution by a vote of 149-12, with 19 abstentions.

US and its ally Israel along with 10 other countries stood against the resolution.

The General Assembly also adopted a draft resolution urging member states to take all measures necessary to ensure Israel's compliance with international law.

The resolution, which also highlights the dire humanitarian situation in Palestine, notes the need for accountability to ensure that Israel respects its international law obligations.

Submitted by Spain along with more than 30 other states, the resolution was backed by 149 countries, with 12 voting against and 19 abstaining.

""As a matter of urgency, the international community must launch a robust message, a message with regard to the situation in Gaza, and we strongly encourage all member states to vote in favour of this draft resolution,"" Spain's UN envoy Hector Gomez Hernandez said before the vote.

Hernandez noted that the draft resolution stressed the commitment to the two-state solution while ""firmly rejecting any attempts at demographic change in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.""

Israel using 'starvation as weapons'

Prior to the vote, Palestine's envoy to the UN Riyad Mansour described the wording of the draft resolution as ""the strongest to date on these matters"".

""Israel's continuing disregard and blatant contempt for the rules of international law, the resolutions of UN bodies and the positions of states around the world must lead to the translation of this language into resolute action, and it has to be done now,"" Mansour said.

Arguing that the resolution ""strongly condemns any use of starvation of civilians as a method of warfare and the unlawful denial of humanitarian access"", he said it also ""stresses the obligation not to deprive civilians"" of their basic needs for survival in the enclave.

""No arms, no money, no trade to oppress Palestinians, ethnically cleanse them and steal their land. Use the tools available to you,"" he urged.

US Charge d’Affaires ad interim Dorothy Shea called the emergency session on Palestine ""another failure on the part of the United Nations to condemn Hamas"".

Arguing that the draft resolution ""sends an unacceptable message"", Shea said the US does not support ""one-sided measures that fail to condemn Hamas. We will not support resolutions that do not call for violent terrorist groups to disarm and leave Gaza and fail to recognise Israel's right to defend itself.""

She also claimed that it ""does nothing to bring calm to Gaza"" and that ""it also does nothing to advance a realistic diplomatic solution to further the cause of peace. It is rife with serious defects.""

The Israeli army has pursued a genocide against Gaza since October 2023, killing nearly 64,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children, rejecting international demands for a ceasefire.

The dead include some 11,000 Palestinians feared buried under rubble of annihilated homes.

Experts, however, contend that the actual death toll significantly exceeds what the Gaza authorities have reported, estimating it could be around 200,000.

The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.

Washington allocates $3.8 billion in annual military funding to its long-standing ally Israel.

Since October 2023, the US has spent more than $22 billion supporting Israel's genocide in Gaza and war in neighbouring countries.

Despite senior US officials criticising Israel regarding the high civilian death toll in Gaza, Washington has, thus far, resisted calls to place conditions on any arms transfers."

On the seventh consecutive day of protests, LA is in no mood to rest. The marches continue.

Hundreds have gathered once again outside City Hall, chanting, dancing, holding hands — a human wall against the federal government's clampdown on undocumented migrants.

The phrase that echoes the loudest here is the same one spray-painted on storefronts and walls all over the second biggest American city: ""ICE out of L.A.""

This city has become the epicentre of a national reckoning over immigration, identity and power.LA, home to Hollywood, now feels trapped inside a movie. The smoke isn't from special effects, and the screams aren't rehearsed.

Behind police lines and beneath looming federal buildings, people like Gus — a Mexican-American man — stands beneath a hand-painted sign that reads: We Are Not Your Enemy. He speaks plainly: ""They're taking families that have worked hard and done nothing but work and pay taxes. They should be accepted. We should start mass integration instead of deportations.""

As Gus talks, the sky darkens just slightly, not from nightfall, but from the wide, lazy blades of a military chopper circling above.

Below, in sharp contrast, a group of young Latinas line-dance to Payaso de Rodeo, a Spanish-language country anthem. Their boots thud rhythmically on the pavement, brief laughter mixing with protest.

Minutes later, the police begin to push.

Officers in riot gear move forward with shields raised, forcing the dancers to scatter before the 8 pm curfew. It's the same each night now — joy, then rupture.

At the federal detention centre nearby, families and friends wait. Many haven't heard from their loved ones since they were swept up in raids last weekend.

Immigration agents have held raids in Oxnard and fanned out across communities in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, home to California's famed strawberries, avocados, and celery crops.

The raids are part of a broad new immigration push by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), bolstered by the presence of over 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 active-duty Marines — the first time in decades a US president has deployed troops this way against the wishes of a state governor.

President Donald Trump says it was necessary.

""If I wasn't there, Los Angeles would have been burning to the ground,"" he told reporters, claiming California's governor ""lost control.""

A US judge on Thursday temporarily barred President Trump from deploying National Guard troops in Los Angeles.

Judge Charles Breyer ordered the National Guard to return to the control of California Governor Gavin Newsom, who sued to restrict its activity. Breyer's order will take effect at noon on Friday.

Earlier today, chaos briefly replaced protocol when Senator Alex Padilla was physically removed from a Homeland Security press briefing inside a packed federal building in LA.The California lawmaker had risen to question Secretary Kristi Noem about the scope and legality of recent ICE raids gripping the city. But before he could speak, security officers closed in. Caught in a political brawl

Meanwhile, Jose Padilla (no relation to the Senator), a soft-spoken Californian, joins the protest holding his son's hand.

""I oppose ICE going into schools, churches, and all that, taking people… taking children,"" he says. ""That’s not what this country’s supposed to be.""

Local authorities say the state will ""fiercely protect people's rights to peacefully assemble"" but also warned that those who engage in violence, theft, or property destruction would face severe consequences.

For many in the protests, the sight of troops on their streets feels like an alarm bell.

""You're preying on people at this point,"" says Alexandra, a protester who has come to protest with her friends.

""I don't care if you came here illegally. If you pay tax like I do — what's the difference?""

Another protester, Ivy, a Native American, adds: ""No one is illegal on stolen land.""

After sunset, the curfew clears the streets of traffic, commerce, and the casual rhythms of LA life. But some protesters remain.

Even with cop cars drifting through alleyways, the marchers return, night after night.

""It's like living in the middle of a slow-moving storm,"" says a resident near Salazar Park, glancing at the line of cop cars rolling past her. ""The helicopters, the sirens, the silence between. It's very disruptive to day-to-day life.""

By day, the city moves through a strange choreography of protest and policing. People bring snacks, first aid kits, and mobile loudspeakers. By night, the soundscape shifts: sirens, flashbangs, the whir of choppers.

Alondra Hernandez, a college student from LA, shrugs when asked why she is showing up. ""We're exercising our rights,"" she says.The words of California's governor Gavin Newsom echo on local radio here: ""Democracy is under assault right before our eyes.""

And yet, in the middle of it all, amid the politics and posturing, the curfews and confrontations, are people like Paula, who stands at the barricades.

""Don't give up,"" she whispers to no one in particular. ""This is our country."""

The Press Trust of India, citing police, reported that as many as 265 bodies were recovered after the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, carrying 230 passengers and 12 crew, crashed into a medical college hostel on Thursday.

Of the total bodies, 241 aboard Flight AI171 were confirmed dead by Air India while at least 24 people, believed to be students and locals, were killed on the ground.

Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, after visiting the site of the plane crash, said the high temperature due to burning fuel in the plane wreckage ""left no chance"" to save passengers.

He added that a final death toll will be announced once the victims are verified by DNA results.

The sole survivor of the crash was identified as British national of Indian origin Viswashkumar Ramesh, who was taken to a hospital.

""Air India offers its deepest condolences to the families of the deceased. Our efforts now are focused entirely on the needs of all those affected, their families and loved ones,"" the airline said in a statement.

Vijay Rupani, a former chief minister of Gujarat, the Western Indian state where the plane went down, was also confirmed dead.

Air India's owner company Tata pledged to provide 10 million Indian Rupees ($116,863) to the deceased's families, cover the medical expenses of the injured, and support the repairing of the hostel.

The flight had 169 Indian nationals aboard, plus 53 UK citizens, seven from Portugal, and one from Canada, in addition to two pilots and 10 members of the cabin crew.

Saw 'about 15 to 20 burned bodies'

Air India's flight 171 issued a mayday call and crashed ""immediately after takeoff"", around 1:40 pm (0810 GMT), India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation said.

Videos posted on social media showed the jet losing altitude — with its nose up — before it hit a medical staff hostel and exploded into a ball of fire.

The plane smashed into a building housing doctors and their families in a crowded residential area of Ahmedabad, a city home to about eight million people.

At the site of the crash between a hospital and the Ghoda Camp neighbourhood, an AFP journalist saw people recovering bodies and firefighters spraying water on the smouldering wreckage.

A resident, who declined to be named, said: ""We saw people from the building jumping from the second and third floor to save themselves. The plane was in flames.""

""When we reached the spot there were several bodies lying around and firefighters were dousing the flames,"" another resident, Poonam Patni, told AFP, adding that many of the bodies were burned.

A doctor named Krishna said that ""the nose and front wheel landed on the canteen building where students were having lunch.""

He said he saw ""about 15 to 20 burned bodies"", while he and his colleagues rescued around 15 students.

Indian Aviation Minister Kinjarapu Ram Mohan Naidu said that a formal investigation had been launched by the Aircraft Accident Investigation.

Aerospace manufacturer Boeing’s President and CEO Kelly Ortberg said Boeing was ready to assist with the investigation.

The British and US accident investigation agencies said they had sent teams to support the Indian inquiry.

A source close to the case said this was the first time a 787 Dreamliner had crashed.

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is the pride of the US company's catalogue for long-distance planes: a fuel-efficient, wide-body, lightweight aircraft able to transport up to 330 people."

“It's not certain that anyone among us knows when and how the attack on Iran will happen,” Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper quoted Eliyahu as saying, amid media reports about Israeli plans to strike Iran on Thursday.

“Everyone remembers the sudden strike on (former Hezbollah Secretary-General) Hassan Nasrallah,” he added.

“In strategy, war is waged suddenly,” Eliyahu said, without providing further details.

His comments came as reports of stalled progress in indirect nuclear negotiations between the US and Iran fuelled uncertainty in the Middle East.

The main sticking point in nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington remains Iran’s uranium enrichment program.

‘Iran would strike US military bases’

While the US demands a complete halt to enrichment, Iranian negotiators insist the program is non-negotiable and will continue with or without a deal.

US President Donald Trump, who has previously advocated for a military response if diplomacy fails, said on Wednesday he was less confident that Iran would agree to stop uranium enrichment.

Iranian Defense Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh warned the same day that Iran would strike US military bases in the region if attacked.

The US, Israel, and several other countries accuse Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and aimed at power generation.

Iran is seeking relief from international sanctions in exchange for limiting some aspects of its nuclear activities while maintaining its right to peaceful nuclear energy under international law.

Israel remains the only country in the region believed to possess a nuclear arsenal, though it has never officially acknowledged it and is not subject to international inspections."

""I am pleased to confirm the 6th round of Iran-US talks will be held in Muscat this Sunday,"" Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said in a post on X.

Tehran and Washington have held five rounds of talks since April to thrash out a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 accord that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.

The announcement by Oman came just hours after President Donald Trump said US personnel were being moved from the potentially ""dangerous"" Middle East. It was eported earlier that the US was preparing a “partial” evacuation of its embassies in Iraq, Bahrain and Kuwait.

Reports of the potential evacuation pushed up oil prices by more than 4 percent before prices eased on Thursday.

Foreign energy companies were continuing their operations as usual, a senior Iraqi official overseeing operations in southern oilfields told Reuters on Thursday.

A US official said the State Department had authorised voluntary departures from Bahrain and Kuwait.

Trump also reiterated that he would not allow Iran to have an atomic bomb amid mounting speculation that Israel could strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran threatened Wednesday to target US military bases in the region if conflict breaks out.

Trump had until recently expressed optimism about the talks, but said in an interview published Wednesday that he was ""less confident"" about reaching a deal.

Since returning to office in January, Trump has revived his ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Tehran, backing nuclear diplomacy but warning of military action if it fails.

The US president says he has pressed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off striking Iran's nuclear facilities to give the talks a chance, but has increasingly signalled that he is losing patience.

Notice to move out

The State Department updated its worldwide travel advisory on Wednesday evening to reflect the latest US posture. ""On June 11, the Department of State ordered the departure of non-emergency US government personnel due to heightened regional tensions,"" the advisory said.

The decision by the US to evacuate some personnel comes at a volatile moment in the region. Trump's efforts to reach a nuclear deal with Iran appear to be deadlocked and US intelligence indicates that Israel has been making preparations for a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.

""They are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place, and we'll see what happens,"" Trump told reporters.

""We've given notice to move out."" Asked whether anything could be done to lower the temperature in the region, Trump said: ""They can't have a nuclear weapon.

Very simple, they can't have a nuclear weapon."" Trump has repeatedly threatened to strike Iran if stuttering talks over its nuclear programme fail and in an interview released earlier on Wednesday said he was growing less confident that Tehran would agree to stop enriching uranium, a key American demand.

While the evacuation of non-essential personnel raised concerns about a possible regional escalation, a senior Iranian security official told Iran's Press TV on Thursday that US military dependents leaving did not constitute a threat.

Shipping in critical waterways

On Wednesday, Iran's defence minister warned Washington that Tehran would hit US regional bases if drawn into a war in the case of nuclear talks failing. The United States has a military presence across the major oil-producing region, with bases in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.

US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations across the Middle East, a US official said. Another US official said that was mostly relevant to family members located in Bahrain - where the bulk of them are based.

On Wednesday Britain's maritime agency warned that increased tensions in the Middle East might lead to an escalation in military activity that could impact shipping in critical waterways.

It advised vessels to use caution while travelling through the Gulf, the Gulf of Oman and the Straits of Hormuz, which all border Iran.

Tensions inside Iraq have heightened since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, with Iran-aligned armed groups in the country repeatedly attacking US troops, though attacks have subsided since last year.

Potential military strike by Israel

Iran will not abandon its right to uranium enrichment because of mounting frictions in the region, a senior Iranian official told Reuters on Thursday, adding that a ""friendly"" regional country had alerted Tehran over a potential military strike by Israel.

The official said the tensions were intended to ""influence Tehran to change its position about its nuclear rights"" during talks with the United States on Sunday in Oman.

US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday US personnel were being moved out of the Middle East because it could be a ""dangerous place"", adding that the United States would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.

Tehran and Washington will hold a new round of talks in Oman's capital, Muscat, to resolve a decades-long standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions.

After five rounds of discussions between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, several obstacles remain. Among them are Iran's rejection of a US demand that it commit to scrapping uranium enrichment."

California officials have accused Trump of adding fuel to the fire by sending 4,000 of the state's National Guard troops — as well as 700 Marines — to the second-largest American city.

Trump disregarded the objections of Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who would typically oversee the troops.

A judge deemed the Republican president's actions ""illegal"", but a higher court paused this after an appeal, citing an ""intrusion"" on presidential authority.

Against this backdrop, TRT World spoke with Doug Rand, a former senior advisor to director of (US Citizenship and Immigration Services), to assess whether Trump's policies risk fracturing the US immigration system.

""I think that the Trump administration is pursuing a very indiscriminate deportation policy where they've told enforcement officers to meet certain arrest numbers on a daily basis and to cast the widest possible net,"" Rand tells TRT World.

Unlike previous administrations that prioritised public safety, ""they're going after anybody who is here without permission, even if they're a grandmother or a high school student or an agricultural worker.""

Rand believes this approach is fuelling the largely peaceful protests in Los Angeles, saying, ""That's what's triggering the mostly peaceful protests in Los Angeles.""

Legal residents and US citizens not spared

The climate of fear is not confined to undocumented immigrants, Rand warns.

""It's not just undocumented immigrants, it's immigrants who have temporary visas, it's even lawful permanent residents, it's US citizens married to immigrants… lawful permanent residents getting picked up… people showing up for their legal immigration interviews, and suddenly finding themselves being arrested by immigration enforcement.""

On the scale of ICE raids, Rand notes, ""the scale is the same as it's always been, because there's only so many ICE officers… In the prior administration, the official policy was, go after undocumented immigrants who have a criminal record… And in the current administration, they've thrown that out the window and said, go after the easiest person you can find.""

Targets now include ""low-hanging fruit"" — individuals found in schools, churches, or courtrooms.

Rand is blunt about the implications for civil liberties.

""This administration does not respect people's due process rights.""

He cites examples of Salvadorans deported without hearings, adding that ""the administration is arguing that that's within their rights, which as a matter of law and precedent, that's ludicrous.""

Rand also highlights ICE tactics of transferring detainees across state lines to face ""more favourable judges.""

Travel ban: Extending old patterns under new pretexts

When asked whether the Trump administration's new travel ban can be legally justified, Rand responded bluntly: ""Well, the US Congress does give presidents expansive power to deny entry to foreign nationals. However, these bans aren't allowed to be arbitrary and it's unconstitutional to discriminate based on race or religion.""

Rand argues that the latest ban is simply an extension of the administration's earlier Muslim ban, now masked by broader justifications.

""It's pretty clear that this new entry ban is both arbitrary and discriminatory. The administration was hunting for any data to justify expanding the Muslim ban — not just to Muslim countries like Afghanistan, but also to countries they've long demonised, such as Cuba and Haiti.""

To support the ban, officials introduced an arbitrary metric — overstay rate — which allowed them to target certain nations while ignoring others.

""They established this arbitrary metric called overstay rate, which allows them to justify extending the travel ban to those countries, but then also randomly sweeps in 10 small countries like Chad, Turkmenistan, and Togo that seem random, but are really just swept up in this pretextual metric,"" says Rand.

But he notes that the true overstay problem lies elsewhere.

""You want to know which countries have a large number of people who have come here and overstayed their visas? Spain — 20,000 people. UK — 15,000 people. France — 9,000 people. It's a lot of European countries.""

""That's all nonsense. If you actually cared about overstays, you wouldn't be targeting Chad or Togo — countries with tiny numbers of actual overstays. The choice of targets makes clear the discriminatory intent.""

Retreating to exclusionary ideology

Reflecting on the broader direction of US immigration policy, Rand laments: ""The last time Congress updated our immigration laws… was in 1990… It's a self-inflicted wound.""

He contends that the Trump administration's current agenda mirrors the nativist 1924 Immigration Act, saying, ""They're clearly trying to approximate that — shutting down asylum, slashing refugee admissions, reducing student visas, and banning family-based immigration from 19 countries.""

Rand concludes grimly: ""We're only seeing the beginning of what may be a very concerted effort to reduce immigration from certain countries, not including Europe, based on a deeply troubling history."""

The diplomatic demarche, sent on Tuesday, says countries that take ""anti-Israel actions"" following the conference will be viewed as acting in opposition to US foreign policy interests and could face diplomatic consequences from Washington.

The demarche, which was not previously reported, runs squarely against the diplomacy of two close allies France and Saudi Arabia, who are co-hosting the gathering next week in New York that aims to lay out the parameters for a roadmap to a Palestinian state, while ensuring Israel's security.

""We are urging governments not to participate in the conference, which we view as counterproductive to ongoing, lifesaving efforts to end the war in Gaza and free hostages,"" read the cable.

President Emmanuel Macron has suggested France could recognise a Palestinian state in Israeli-occupied territory at the conference. French officials say they have been working to avoid a clash with the US, Israel's staunchest major ally.

""The United States opposes any steps that would unilaterally recognise a conjectural Palestinian state, which adds significant legal and political obstacles to the eventual resolution of the conflict and could coerce Israel during a war, thereby supporting its enemies,"" the cable read.

This week Britain and Canada, also G7 allies of the United States, were joined by other countries in placing sanctions on two Israeli far-right government ministers to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the Gaza war to an end.

""The United States opposes the implied support of the conference for potential actions including boycotts and sanctions on Israel as well as other punitive measures,"" the cable read.

Israel has repeatedly criticised the conference, saying it rewards Hamas for the October 7, 2023 blitz on Israel. It has lobbied France against recognising a Palestinian state.

The US State Department and the French Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Israel has been carrying out a genocide in Gaza since October 2023. Palestinians have recorded killings of more than 55,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children.

Some 11,000 Palestinians feared buried under rubble of annihilated homes, according to Palestine's official WAFA news agency.

Experts, however, contend that the actual death toll significantly exceeds what the Gaza authorities have reported, estimating it could be around 200,000.

The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.

Washington allocates $3.8 billion in annual military funding to its long-standing ally Israel.

Since October 2023, the US has spent more than $22 billion supporting Israel's genocide in Gaza and war in neighbouring countries.

Despite senior US officials criticising Israel regarding the high civilian death toll in Gaza, Washington has, thus far, resisted calls to place conditions on any arms transfers."

""The State Department is set to have an ordered departure for (the) US embassy in Baghdad. The intent is to do it through commercial means, but the US military is standing by if help is requested,"" another US official said on Wednesday.

The United States Department of State was preparing to order nonessential embassy personnel and family members to leave Bahrain and Kuwait, the Associated Press news agency reported.

An Iraqi Foreign Ministry official said a ""partial evacuation"" of US embassy staff had been confirmed due to what the official termed ""potential security concerns related to possible regional tensions.""

""President Trump is committed to keeping Americans safe, both at home and abroad. In keeping with that commitment, we are constantly assessing the appropriate personnel posture at all our embassies,"" an official told Anadolu Agency.

""Based on our latest analysis, we decided to reduce our Mission in Iraq.""

Another US official said that there was no change in operations at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US military base in the Middle East and that no evacuation order had been issued for employees or families linked to the US Embassy in Qatar, which was operating as usual.

It comes as US President Donald Trump said he was less confident that Iran will agree to stop uranium enrichment in a nuclear deal with Washington, according to an interview released on Wednesday.

He has repeatedly threatened Iran with bombing if it does not reach a new nuclear deal.

Also on Wednesday, Iran's Minister of Defence Aziz Nasirzadeh warned that Tehran will strike US bases in the region if conflict arises with Washington.

The Iranian minister's comments came a day after General Michael Kurilla, commander of US Central Command (CENTCOM), testified before Congress, saying he presented a ""range of options"" to President Trump to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

In response to a question from House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers about whether CENTCOM is prepared to use force if Iran continues its nuclear activities, Kurilla said yes.

Tensions between Tehran and Washington remain high despite ongoing indirect nuclear negotiations mediated by Oman.

The main sticking point remains Iran's uranium enrichment programme.

While the US demands a complete halt to enrichment, Iranian negotiators insist the programme is non-negotiable and will continue with or without a deal.

The sixth round of nuclear talks is scheduled to take place on Sunday in Muscat."

The city has become a battleground where ICE raids are meeting a rising defiance.","Los Angeles, California — The sun cuts through a haze of dust over Alameda Street. Pigeons scatter, startled by the clang of an overturned dumpster being kicked nearby. The calm in America's second-biggest city is fractured, scattered shards of unease settling into every corner. From Boyle Heights to Venice, Los Angeles has shifted. It grits its teeth beneath a sky swollen with unrest.

Four days ago, whispers rippled through multiple immigrant neighbourhoods. Raids conducted by federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were coming.

Like tremors before an earthquake, the warnings passed from hand to hand. Doors were bolted, curtains drawn tight, and teenagers took to the streets with faces masked in defiance.

Soon, President Donald Trump sent federal troops onto California soil without permission from Governor Gavin Newsom. The city began to simmer. By Wednesday morning, graffiti had spread like veins through the city's walls — under overpasses, across shuttered storefronts, on the steps of government buildings. No peace. No ICE. No silence. The paint is fresh.

In a primetime address last night, Governor Newsom urged Californians to hold firm: ""Do not give in to him."" He was referring to President Trump.

The words landed like a match.

Marines are positioned across Los Angeles, standing watch as tensions simmer and the city braces under curfew.

As the curfew was lifted early on Wednesday for the day, dozens of families whose loved ones were swept up in raids returned to the federal detention centre downtown.

They formed a chain — hands clasped, holding placards — and began to chant. “Libertad. Justicia. Libertad.”Police held the line, but the tension was thick enough to chew.

The Marines now stand watch outside the Federal Building. Their rifles rest against riot shields, poised but not raised.

According to Major General Scott Sherman, who is overseeing the deployment of 4,700 federal troops in California, the 700 Marines assigned to Los Angeles ""do not have arrest powers,"" but are allowed to detain individuals ""until law enforcement arrives.""

For now, that presence is mostly visual. A show of force: quiet, hulking, and unmistakable.

Near Civic Center area, close to City Hall and the Main Street Bridge, a man in a worn Lakers jersey leans on a fence, voice low and raw.

They came for his cousin, he said. No knock, no warning. ICE smashed through.

""I thought that was over,"" he says, eyes shadowed. Across the city, the number of National Guard troops has doubled. Trump says they are here to stop Los Angeles from ""burning down.""But the fire is visible in spray-painted screams across boarded-up shops, in hulks of a Waymo car torched in Westlake. The machine didn't bleed, but the message did.

Graffiti is sprayed along multiple prominent buildings in LA, cutting through the quiet after curfew. (Sadiq S. Bhat/TRT World)

The Los Angeles Police Department (or LAPD) insists the situation is under control. District Attorney Nathan Hochman says local law enforcement remains ""in the driver’s seat.""

But the more than 600 rubber bullets fired since Friday speak louder than either.

Trump has threatened Newsom with arrest and accused the state of harbouring criminals.

But the city hums louder than the president's tweets. Over the last few days, hundreds have gathered outside the federal detention centre.Tear gas was unleashed, and flashbangs exploded like thunderclaps. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, speaking late on Tuesday night, called the moment a ""manufactured emergency."" Behind her, sirens cut the air. ""This is a deliberate attempt to provoke disorder,"" she said. ""To push people past the edge.""

The unrest has spread to New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, Austin, San Francisco. Every city now carries its own version of LA's anxiety, stitched together by fear of ICE raids.

Wednesday morning in downtown LA tastes like metal and ash. The city feels like a live wire, charged and humming. It is caught between two magnets: federal edicts and human desperation. One side fights for dignity, the other for dominance.

Parts of Los Angeles, the second largest city in the US, are deserted after protests broke out against federal immigration sweeps.

Inside corner stores, opened after long curfew hours, conversations slip into whispers. Raids. Deportations. Marines. People cling to their phones, waiting for news — or silence.

By noon, another protest is planned outside the Hall of Justice. In the last few days, it has been quiet at first. Then comes the beat of a drum, the rise of chants, the raising of signs that say simply: Let them go.

At the epicentre of America's immigration battleground, Los Angeles feels not just a city under siege. It is a mirror held up to the nation.

Near the protest, beside a line of photos of missing loved ones, a woman in her sixties watches the chanting families. She clutches a bag of pan dulce, untouched.

""They say this is about law,"" she murmurs, not looking away. ""But I only see mothers screaming into fences."""

Officials were also preparing for nationwide anti-Trump demonstrations on Saturday, when tanks and armoured vehicles will rumble down the streets of Washington, DC, in a military parade marking the US Army's 250th anniversary and coinciding with the president's 79th birthday.

The governor of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, said he will deploy the National Guard on Wednesday ahead of planned protests. Already this week, demonstrations have broken out in Austin, Texas, New York, Atlanta and Chicago, among other cities.

Trump's decision to send National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles has sparked a national debate on the use of military on US soil and pitted the Republican president against California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom.

Trump has claimed that the deployment prevented the violence from raging out of control, an assertion Newsom and other local officials said was the opposite of the truth.

Newsom, who is widely expected to mount a presidential run in 2028, sued Trump and the Defense Department on Monday, seeking to block the deployment of federal troops. Trump in turn has suggested that Newsom should be arrested.

Hundreds of Marines arrived in the Los Angeles area on Tuesday under orders from Trump, who has also called up 4,000 National Guard troops to the city. The Marines and National Guard are assigned to protect government personnel and buildings and do not have arrest authority.

About 700 Marines were in a staging area in the Seal Beach area about 50 km south of Los Angeles on Tuesday, awaiting deployment to specific locations, a US official said.

Police said multiple groups stayed on the streets in some areas despite the curfew and ""mass arrests"" were initiated.

Protests that sprang up in Los Angeles have begun to spread across the country.

From Seattle and Austin to Chicago and Washington, DC, marchers have chanted slogans, carried signs against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and snarled traffic through downtown avenues and outside federal offices.

While many have been peaceful, some have resulted in clashes with law enforcement as officers made arrests and used chemical irritants to disperse crowds.

A look at some protests across the country:

About 150 protesters gathered outside the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia on Tuesday afternoon and marched to ICE headquarters for speeches and then back to the detention center, according to Philadelphia police.

A group then walked though what police called major roads using bicycles to obstruct officers, prompting police to issue several orders for people to disperse. Police said demonstrators ignored the orders and things escalated when officers started arresting people.

About 200 protesters gathered outside the San Francisco Immigration Court on Tuesday after activists said several arrests were made there.

About 50 people gathered outside the immigration court in downtown Seattle on Tuesday, chanting with drums and holding up signs that said, ""Free Them All; Abolish ICE"" and ""No to Deportations."" Protesters began putting scooters in front of building entryways before police arrived.

A mass of people rallied in lower Manhattan on Tuesday evening to protest deportations and federal immigration policy.

Demonstrators gathered outside two federal buildings that house immigration courts and began marching amid a heavy police presence.

Some protesters held signs reading ""ICE out of New York"" and others chanted, ""Why are you in riot gear? I don’t see no riot here."" New York City police said multiple people were taken into custody. There were no immediate charges.

In Chicago, a small crowd gathered on Tuesday outside immigration court in downtown and called for an end to Trump administration immigration sweeps and military presence in California.

""With the militarisation of Los Angeles it's time to get out and let Trump know this is unacceptable,"" said retiree Gary Snyderman. ""All of this is so unconstitutional.""

The group then marched through downtown streets drumming and chanting, ""No more deportations! and “Trump must go now."" The demonstration had grown to at least a thousand protesters by late on Tuesday, remaining relatively peaceful with limited engagement between the group and police officers.

A group of protesters gathered in front of the Colorado state capitol in Denver on Tuesday, creating a sea of cardboard signs, one exhorting: ""Show your faces. ICE cowards.""

The group, inspired by the Los Angeles protests over the past several days, split in half, marching down two different thoroughfares and crowding out traffic.

A large police presence wasn't seen initially, but a few officers began blocking a street behind the the marchers.

In Santa Ana near Los Angeles, armoured vehicles blocked the road on Tuesday morning leading into the Civic Center, where federal immigration officers and numerous city and county agencies have their offices.

Workers swept up plastic bottles and broken glass from Monday's protests. Tiny shards of red, black and purple glass littered the pavement. Nearby buildings and the sidewalk were tagged with profane graffiti slogans against ICE and had Trump’s name crossed out. A worker rolled paint over graffiti on a wall to block it out.

National Guard officers wearing fatigues and carrying rifles prevented people from entering the area unless they worked there.

San Antonio Police Chief William McManus confirmed that Texas Governor Greg Abbot sent members of the state's National Guard to the city in advance of protests expected this week, Assistant Chief Jesse Salame told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

""We don’t have any additional details about their deployment,""Salame said.

Soldiers were ""on standby in areas where mass demonstrations are planned in case they are needed,"" Abbott spokesperson Andrew Mahaleris said on Tuesday evening.

Four Austin police officers were injured and authorities used chemical irritants to disperse a crowd of several hundred demonstrators on Monday night that moved between the state Capitol and a federal building that houses an ICE office.

State officials had closed the Capitol to the public an hour early in anticipation of the protest.

Austin police used pepper spray balls and state police used tear gas when demonstrators began trying to deface the federal building with spray paint. The demonstrators then started throwing rocks, bottles and other objects at a police barricade, Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis said.

A protest that drew hundreds to a rally on a city bridge lasted for several hours on Monday night before Dallas police declared it an ""unlawful assembly"" and warned people to leave or face possible arrest.

Dallas police initially posted on social media that officers would not interfere with a ""lawful and peaceful assembly of individuals or groups expressing their First Amendment rights.""

But officers later moved in and media reported seeing some in the crowd throw objects as officers used pepper spray and smoke to clear the area. At least one person was arrested.

Hundreds of people gathered in Boston’s City Hall Plaza on Monday.

Protesters held signs reading ""Massachusetts stands with our neighbours in Los Angeles"" and ""Protect our immigrant neighbours,"" and shouted, ""Come for one, come for all"" and ""Free David, free them all.""

Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union California, was released from federal custody later Monday on $50,000 bond.

Several unions gathered on Monday in Washington to protest the raids and rally for Huerta’s release, and marched past the Department of Justice building.

Among the demonstrators was US Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state.

""Enough of these mass ICE raids that are sweeping up innocent people,"" Jayapal said. ""As we see people exercising the constitutional rights to peacefully use their voices to speak out against this injustice, they are being met with tear gas and rubber bullets."""

""We have to have a relationship with Pakistan and with India. I do not believe it is a binary switch that we can't have one with Pakistan if we have a relationship with India,"" General Michael Kurilla said on Tuesday.

""We should look at the merits of the relationship for the positives that it has.""

Kurilla made the comments during a testimony before the US House Armed Services Committee.

Pakistan is ""in an active counterterrorism fight right now and they have been a phenomenal partner in the counterterrorism world,"" the top American general added, referring to Islamabad's counter-terrorism operations in the region.

""ISIS Khorasan (ISIS-K or Daesh in Khorasan) is perhaps one of the most active in trying to do external plots globally to include against the homeland. The Taliban is going after ISIS K — they hate each other, and have pushed a lot of them into the tribal areas on the Afghan-Pakistan border,"" Kurilla said at the full Committee Hearing on 'US Military Posture and National Security Challenges AFRICOM + CENTCOM.'

""Through a phenomenal partnership with Pakistan, they have gone after ISIS Khorasan, killing dozens of them. Through a relationship we have with them providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ISIS Khorasan high value individuals.""

Kurilla said Pakistan extradited Daesh group's Mohammad Sharifullah, also known as Jafar, to face charges for his role in the August 26, 2021 Kabul airport bombing.

In March, Pakistani intelligence officers stated that they arrested Sharifullah in the country's restive southwest Balochistan province, near the border with Afghanistan, after multiple operations had previously failed to capture him.

Sharifullah is charged in federal court in Virginia state with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organisation, resulting in deaths.

The Abbey Gate bombing, in the waning days of an airlift for those fleeing the Taliban takeover of the country amid the withdrawal by US forces, occurred in August 2021 when a suicide bomber attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabul's airport.

Besides 13 US service members, about 170 Afghans were also killed in the attack, which triggered widespread congressional criticism and undermined public confidence in the Biden administration's handling of the conclusion of the war.

During his testimony, General Kurilla added that he was the first person Pakistan's then Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir had called and had said: ""I've caught him. I'm willing to extradite him back to the United States. Please tell the Secretary of Defence and the President'.""

""So we are seeing Pakistan, with limited intelligence that we're providing them, go after them, using their means to do that, and we're seeing an effect on ISIS-K,"" he said.

""The ISIS-K terrorists are continuing to move around and sometimes they'll try and go back into Afghanistan… for the most part right now, they're hanging out right in that border area of Pakistan,"" he added.

US role in Pakistan-India truce

Also on Tuesday, the US administration reiterated that President Donald Trump remains open to playing a mediating role in the decades-long conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, framing such an initiative as part of his broader commitment to resolving long-standing international disputes.

During a press briefing, State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that ""we all recognise that President Trump in each step that he takes, it’s made to solve generational differences between countries, generational war,"" suggesting that it would not be surprising if Trump chose to remain engaged with the issue.

India and Pakistan saw one of the worst hostilities early this month, sparked by an April 22 attack in India-administered Kashmir, where unidentified gunmen killed 26 people, mostly Indian tourists, at the Pahalgam tourist site.​​​​​​​

A shadowy group called The Resistance Front purportedly claimed responsibility, according to an unverified claim quoted by some Indian media outlets. Later, the group withdrew its claims as per media reports.

New Delhi, which has deployed more than 500,000 troops in the tiny and disputed Himalayan region, swiftly blamed Islamabad for the attack without probe or providing any evidence publicly.

Islamabad declared it a ""false flag"" operation and suggested an impartial investigation, which New Delhi dismissed.

Tensions spiked when India launched missile and drone attacks on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, that Islamabad says killed dozens of civilians. Islamabad launched counter missile and drone strikes, targeting Indian military bases in several areas in India and India-administered Kashmir.

Pakistan stated it downed six Indian aircraft, Rafale jets included.

After weeks of denial, General Anil Chauhan, India's chief of defence staff, admitted that an unspecified number of its warplanes were shot down by Pakistan during May dogfights.

Tensions eased after US President Trump announced a May 10 ceasefire, which remains in effect.

New Delhi rejects Trump's role in ceasefire and says it has only suspended the fighting, while Islamabad hails Trump and his State Department officials for stopping a fight that both US and Pakistani leaders say could have turned into a nuclear conflict."

The decision comes on Wednesday as President Lee, leader of the Democratic Party, begins to implement his campaign pledge to rebuild trust with Pyongyang and restore dialogue on the Korean Peninsula.

“The decision was made as part of efforts to carry out the promise of restoring inter-Korean trust and peace,” a South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) official said.

The broadcasts — which typically include South Korean news, pop music, and messages critical of the North Korean leadership — had been resumed in June of last year after Pyongyang sent waves of trash-filled balloons across the border.

Tensions between the two Koreas have escalated sharply in recent years, with diplomatic channels frozen and several bilateral agreements scrapped during the term of former President Yoon Suk-yeol, who was ousted earlier this year. Lee’s administration has vowed to reverse course and pursue a more conciliatory approach.

Observers view the suspension of the broadcasts as a symbolic but meaningful gesture toward reducing hostilities and reopening channels for dialogue."
6/11/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/c444d442014c,"Professors of populism: How academics are shaping Europe’s far-rightA new wave of European nationalist leaders, from Poland to Portugal, holds academic credentials, blending intellectual expertise and populist ideology. Do these cases suggest a shift in European politics?","When Donald Trump launched a campaign on Harvard University’s admissions policies and broader educational culture, it was framed as part of a wider assault against what he called “wokeness” in American academia.

But across the Atlantic, a different kind of academic is gaining political traction, not in opposition to populism, but in defence of it.

Karol Nawrocki, a historian with a PhD in the humanities, was elected president of Poland two weeks ago. An admirer of Trump’s nationalist agenda, Nawrocki is not an isolated case.

In Germany, Alice Weidel, co-chair of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), is an economist whose doctoral research focused on China’s pension system at the University of Bayreuth.

In Portugal, Andre Ventura, leader of the far-right Chega party, holds a PhD in public law.

In Romania, George Simion, another far-right figure and historian, and a Trump admirer, recently lost a presidential election to a pro-EU candidate but played a vocal role in supporting Nawrocki’s campaign.

Poland's Carol Nawrocki and Romania's George Simion embraced during a recent rally in Poland ahead of the Polish presidential election.

The emergence of these figures raises a question: are nationalist academics becoming a trend in European politics? Is this an actual shift or isolationist exceptions?

“It’s not a model,” says Emmanuel Dupuy, a political scientist at the Catholic University of Lille and president of the Institute for European Perspective and Security Studies (IPSE), a think-tank focused on track-two diplomacy and strategic analysis.

“I must say that it is not the norm across Europe. While there are far-right politicians from academic backgrounds, not all are from academia,” Dupuy tells TRT World.

Critics of populism often deride it for offering simplistic answers to complex issues, from migration to economic policy to the Israel Palestine conflict. But Dupuy sees academic participation in right-wing politics as symptomatic of a broader sociological trend: growing disillusionment with mainstream political elites.

“Very simple and very easy to say that academics are not from Mars,” he says. “They represent ideologies like everyone else. An academic is not inherently neutral, they have personal and political beliefs, often shaped by their family and social and political background.”

Academics, Dupuy adds, are not “out of the society”, but “inside the society”. “It is perfectly normal that some choose to apply their expertise in a political context.”

While Dupuy sees the emergence of academic politicians as part of a change in the general sociology of elected political leadership in Europe, Chega leader Ventura said that he has viewed academia and politics in different dimensions.

Chega leader Andre Ventura addresses media and his supporters, following Portugal's general election, in Lisbon, May 19, 2025. (AP/Ana Brigida)

Ventura, for his part, insists on separating his academic work from his politics. When questioned about the apparent contradiction between his PhD thesis, which critiques “criminal populism”, stigmatisation of minorities, and the expansion of police powers and his current far-right positions, Ventura claimed that his academic writing was “scientific analysis, not ideological postulate.”

Not nationalist, but ‘sovereigntist’

For Dupuy, it's not “very difficult to understand” that these right-wing academicians adopt “some elements of sovereignty or the reaffirmation of the sovereignty of their country” whether it's Poland or Portugal.

As a result, he does not call them nationalists but sovereignists. Across the EU territory, many far-right groups have emerged in their opposition of the union’s federalist policies which they believe violate their own countries’ sovereign rules.

“It’s not very difficult to understand,” he says, “that these right-wing academics are advocating a reaffirmation of their countries’ sovereignty.”

However, Dupuy adds that the academic influence on far-right politics remains limited in countries like Italy and France, where populist leaders often lack academic credentials.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, despite her adoption of hardline policies, does not come from an academic background. Nor do French far-right leaders Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella. Bardella, an anti-immigration politician, is himself the son of migrants.

“Moment of political rediscovery”

Dupuy also dismisses the influence of Renaud Camus, a far-right French academic, whom many credit for the rise of anti-migrant “The Great Replacement” theory, which claims that migrants would eventually replace natives if migration were not stopped across Europe.

Renaud Camus, who formulated the term, ""the great replacement,"" sits in his house during an interview with the AP in Plieux, southwestern France. Photo: Oleg Cetinic

“Camus represents nothing politically,” says Dupuy. “Camus spoke academically about the question of migration, which was in the rhetoric of the nationalist parties for ten to twenty years before Camus ever wrote about it. His ideas were already in the rhetoric of nationalist parties long before he wrote about them.”

Ecaterina Matoi, a Romanian academic at the Bucharest-based Middle East Political and Economic Institute (MEPEI), agrees with Dupuy. “Camus never reached the level of influence that Marine Le Pen has,” she says.

But Matoi also draws attention to the fact that “in this moment of political rediscovery, the European community should not forget” that former German Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, a mainstream conservative leader, was also “an academic.”

Trump made the remarks as he was celebrating soldiers in North Carolina on Tuesday.

Trump also claimed Los Angeles was being invaded by a ""foreign enemy.""""We will not allow an American city to be invaded and conquered by a foreign enemy,"" Trump told troops at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, speaking about the protests, which were sparked by immigration raids.

""What you're witnessing in California is a full-blown assault on peace, on public order and national sovereignty, carried out by rioters bearing foreign flags with the aim of continuing a foreign invasion of our country.""

Trump's visit to Fort Bragg, home to some 50,000 active-duty soldiers, for long-scheduled commemorations of the US Army's 250th anniversary followed his move to deploy 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in an escalating response to street protests over his immigration policies.

The Republican president defended the decision to reporters, saying it was needed to protect federal property and personnel.

California's Democratic-led government has said the move is an abuse of power and an unnecessary provocation.

Street demonstrations in Southern California have been underway since Friday, when activists clashed with sheriff's deputies.

In North Carolina, Trump addressed troops after he and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth watched soldiers demonstrate a special forces assault on a building and use a long-range missile launcher on base.

It was the first in a series of celebrations of the Army anniversary involving Trump, ahead of a major parade in Washington on Saturday.

Trump on Tuesday warned against demonstrations against that parade, telling reporters ""they're going to be met with very big force."" The FBI and the Metropolitan Police Department have said there are no credible threats to the event.

The week's Army commemorations combine Trump's penchant for patriotic pomp and his political positioning as a law-and-order president. Saturday's celebrations in Washington include thousands of troops, dozens of military aircraft and coincide with Trump's 79th birthday.

The Army was established on June 14, 1775, more than a year before the Declaration of Independence.

Earlier this year, Trump restored the name Fort Bragg to the base, one of the largest in the world, despite a federal law that prohibits honoring generals who fought for the South during the Civil War. His administration says the name now honors a different Bragg - Private First Class Roland Bragg, who served during World War Two.

In 2023, the base had been renamed Fort Liberty, a change driven by racial justice protests.

Since launching his second term in office in January, Trump has made the military a focus of his efforts, with his defense secretary working to purge transgender service members, top officials appointed under his Democratic predecessor and even books deemed out of step.

The president's cost-cutting government reforms have largely spared the Defense Department's nearly $1 trillion annual budget. He has pledged to avoid international conflict while launching new weapons programs and increasing the use of the military domestically, including in immigration enforcement.

Trump has pledged to deport record numbers of people who are in the country “illegally” and to lock down the US-Mexico border, setting the ICE border enforcement agency a daily goal of arresting at least 3,000 irregular migrants.

Demonstrators in Los Angeles have assembled, among other places, at a government facility where immigrants are detained."

""We find that extremely unhelpful. It will do nothing to get us closer to a ceasefire in Gaza. This, again, is about allied sanctions against Israeli ministers. They should focus on the real culprit, which is Hamas,"" US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce told media on Tuesday.

Bruce was reacting to the statements of the countries that Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir will be subject to a travel ban and an asset freeze.

Ben-Gvir and Smotrich ""have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights"", the Foreign Ministers of the five countries said in a joint statement on Tuesday.

""These actions are not acceptable. This is why we have taken action now — to hold those responsible to account,"" they added.

Smotrich and Ben Gvir, key figures in Netanyahu's coalition government, have faced scrutiny for their rigid stance on the Gaza war and remarks on illegal Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.

Smotrich, who lives in occupied West Bank settlement, supports the expansion of illegal settlements and has increasingly called for the annexation of Palestinian territory.

Last month, he said Gaza would be ""entirely destroyed"" and that civilians would ""start to leave in great numbers to third countries"".

Ben-Gvir has also called for Palestinians in Gaza to be expelled from the besieged territory.

The measures see the five countries break from Israel's closest ally, the United States.

Bruce expressed dismay at the decision and urged the allies to support aid distribution by Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a US-led initiative backed by Israel in Israeli-occupied zones.

""If our allies want to help, they should focus on supporting special envoy (Steve) Witkoff's negotiations and backing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHZ) when it comes to food and aid,"" she said.

The mechanism of GHF has been opposed by the international community and the UN, which came as an alternative attempt by Israel to bypass the aid distribution through UN channels.

More than 130 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 1,000 wounded by Israeli forces while attempting to access food from aid sites since the GHF programme began on May 27. At least nine people are still missing.

When asked to comment on remarks from Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, in which he said the US is no longer pursuing the goal of an independent Palestinian state, Bruce said ""I'm not going to begin a conversation speculating based on a statement Ambassador Huckabee, may or may not have made.""

According to an interview with Bloomberg News released on Tuesday, Huckabee said ""I don't think"" Palestinian state is US policy goal.

Huckabee, ex-Arkansas governor and a pro-Israel conservative, was selected by President Donald Trump as his envoy to Israel.

""Unless there are some significant things that happen that change the culture, there's no room for it,"" Huckabee was quoted as saying. Those probably won't happen ""in our lifetime,"" he told the news agency.

Huckabee's comments are seen as a clear departure from established US Middle East diplomacy."

The Liberian-flagged vessel VELA, which arrived from Spain on June 9, underwent a thorough inspection by Turkish authorities, who found no evidence supporting the claims.

“The loading manifest and customs records were meticulously examined,” Türkiye’s Center for Combating Disinformation said in a statement posted on X on Tuesday.

“No steel or military-purpose items registered under the name of Israel Military Industries (IMI) or any similar institution were detected on the ship.”

According to the centre, a total of 461 containers were unloaded in Mersin. Of these, 220 were empty and 241 were loaded.

Authorities confirmed that none of the loaded containers contained materials that could be used for military purposes.

Transit cargo bound for other countries, not IsraelFurther investigations revealed that the ship was carrying 1,570 transit containers en route to third countries, and 33 loaded containers—inspected and cleared—originated from Türkiye and were bound for Palestine, primarily carrying food supplies.

In its statement, the centre emphasised Türkiye’s strict adherence to international trade regulations and its transparency in port operations. Turkish ports handle nearly eight million containers annually and are subject to robust customs scrutiny.

The government reiterated that all trade with Israel was fully suspended on May 2, 2024, in response to what it described as Israel’s unlawful actions in Gaza.

Since then, Türkiye’s customs system has been closed to all trade transactions involving Israel, including within free zones and ports.

“Türkiye is among the first countries to take the clearest and most principled stance against Israel’s unlawful attacks in Gaza,” the centre stated, urging the public not to lend credence to “unfounded allegations.”

The Trade Ministry previously confirmed the trade suspension was in response to Israel's ""aggression against Palestine in violation of international law and human rights."""

The swap on Tuesday follows an earlier agreement reached during rare face-to-face talks in Istanbul last week, which led to the release of captured soldiers under the age of 25.

Moscow said the freed Russian servicemen from the latest handover were now in Belarus, which borders both Ukraine and Russia, and would soon return home for medical treatment and rehabilitation.

While the prisoner exchanges offer a rare sign of humanitarian cooperation between the warring sides, broader negotiations remain stalled.

The Istanbul talks marked the first formal diplomatic contact in over three years but the parties did not reach a breakthrough for ceasefire.

'US not a strong mediator'

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said it is his responsibility to lead negotiations with Russia on territorial matters, stressing that Ukraine’s sovereignty is not up for discussion by intermediaries.

“It is my job to hold talks on territories – and (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s, who seized them (in the ongoing war). I will not discuss my position on this with anyone else,” Zelenskyy said in an interview with Hungarian outlet Valasz Online.

His comments came in response to a question about Ukraine’s willingness to compromise during ongoing peace negotiations with Russia. He confirmed that a memorandum submitted to Moscow during last week’s talks in Istanbul no longer referenced Ukraine’s 1991 borders.

“Our memorandum is the basis for negotiations. Based on this, our delegation has a mandate to discuss humanitarian issues – the issue of prisoners of war and abducted children – or a ceasefire. “However, they do not have a mandate to discuss Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is our own constitutional matter,” he said.

He called for the involvement of “strong mediators” in future negotiations to ensure Russia adheres to any agreements reached.

“The United States does not appear to be a strong mediator at the moment: the Russians told them not to be at the table, and they simply walked away. Why? Because of their soft policy towards Russia,” he said.

Zelenskyy argued that lasting peace would require pressure from international actors who understand Putin’s “true goals.”"

The number of extremists within the AfD, which came second in a federal election in February, rose by 77 percent last year to 20,000 in tandem with a growth in party membership and its shift rightwards, the agency said on Tuesday.

The agency last month classified the party at large as “extremist” on the basis of a 1,100-page experts’ report enabling it to step up monitoring of the AfD, although the party has legally challenged this.

Party statements frequently included xenophobic and anti-Muslim positions, with migrants from predominantly Islamic countries often accused of cultural incompatibility and a strong inclination towards criminal behaviour, the agency said.

AfD leaders frequently made statements that could be considered to attack the constitution during state election campaigns in eastern Germany last year - and mostly were not reined in by the party, the agency said.

It cited the leader of the AfD in Thuringia, Bjoern Hoecke, who at a campaign event in August said the election could “lead to the implosion of the cartel party system” and “finally bring about something that is a true democracy”.

Crime motivated by right-wing extremism in Germany jumped 47.4 percent last year, including six attempted murders up from four in 2023 and 23 cases of arson up from 16, the agency said."

Seoul urging Beijing to “play a constructive role” in the process came during the first telephonic conversation between Chinese President Xi Jinping and newly elected South Korean President Lee Jae-myung.

Lee assumed office last week after winning the snap presidential polls, triggered by the ousting of Yoon Suk-yeol over his failed bid to impose martial law last December.

Xi told Lee that China “will make efforts to resolve the issue,” according to South Korea's presidential spokeswoman Kang Yu-jung.

“Promoting peace and stability on the peninsula would serve as mutual interests for both South Korea and China,” said Xi.

The Korean Peninsula has remained divided since the 1950s inter-Korean war, and Seoul has repeatedly sought Pyongyang to denuclearize after its first tests in 2006.

Ties between the divided Koreas have remained at an all-time low since South Korea’s ousted President Yoon assumed office in 2022.

Xi and Lee also discussed bilateral ties, trade, and ""strategic cooperative partnership.”

China and South Korea should promote their strategic cooperative partnership to a higher level, said Xi.

It was the third phone call between Lee and a foreign leader. He earlier spoke to US President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.

Xi urged Beijing and Seoul to jointly safeguard multilateralism and free trade, to ensure stable and smooth global and regional industrial and supply chains.

He stressed that the two sides should ""inject more certainty into regional and international situations.""

Lee also invited Xi to South Korea for November's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, the Seoul-based Yonhap News reported.

""China is an important partner to us in all aspects, including the economy and security.

""I hope that the two countries, which are the APEC chair countries this year and next year, will work closely together on the occasion of APEC and build a Korea-China strategic cooperative partnership that can make a real contribution to the lives of the two peoples,"" Lee said on X.

Speaking at a news conference following the opening of the Board of Governors meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said the level of enrichment being carried out by Tehran “cannot be ignored.”

“Uranium enrichment per se is not a forbidden activity, which is something my Iranian counterparts always tell me,” Grossi said. “But when you accumulate and continue to accumulate…very, very close to what is needed for a nuclear explosive device, then we cannot ignore it.”

“There is no medical or civilian use for it. That is why it is important for us,” he added.

While enrichment is permitted under international law and Iran’s commitments under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Grossi made it clear that the degree and pace of Iran’s enrichment program raises red flags from a safeguards perspective.

His remarks came amid renewed diplomatic tension over Iran’s nuclear file. Iran and the US have engaged in five rounds of indirect talks since April, mediated by Oman, in a bid to find a path back to a nuclear agreement following the US’s 2018 withdrawal from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).

But a major obstacle remains: Iran’s refusal to halt enrichment, which it insists is its sovereign right under the NPT. Iran, meanwhile, said that a new round of nuclear negotiations with the US have been planned for Sunday.

Responding to questions about a potential referral of Iran’s nuclear case to the UN Security Council and the reactivation of the “snapback” sanctions mechanism, Grossi said: “Well, I think everything is interconnected.”

He noted that while the IAEA remains a technical body, it supports diplomatic efforts between Tehran and Washington and continues its verification work independently.

Grossi also commented on Iran’s claim that it had obtained documents related to Israel’s nuclear program.

“This seems to refer to Soreq, which is a research facility which we inspect, by the way,” he said, noting that the agency has not received any official communication about the issue.

He said that while the IAEA monitors the Soreq site under a limited safeguards agreement with Israel, it does not have access to other parts of Israel’s nuclear infrastructure, including the Dimona facility.

Addressing recent Israeli threats of a military strike against Iran’s nuclear sites, Grossi emphasised the agency’s role in promoting peaceful solutions.

“We are trying to solve this without the use of violence or force,” he said.

Iran has responded by warning that it would retaliate forcefully against any such attack, with officials vowing “a devastating response” to any Israeli military action.

While Grossi reiterated that the IAEA is not accusing Iran of developing nuclear weapons, he stressed that the current levels of enrichment demand international attention and verification.

“Because of the fact that we haven't received the answers we need, we cannot assure that everything is in peaceful uses,” he said."
6/9/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/d096878699e2,"'We dissent': NIH scientists publicly slam Trump's cuts to world's premier medical research agencyOver 90 researchers, programme directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on Bethesda Declaration — and their careers on the line — against termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion.","National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya pledged his openness to views that might conflict with his own. ""Dissent, he said, ""is the very essence of science.""

That commitment is being put to the test.

On Monday, scores of scientists at the world's premier medical research agency sent their Trump-appointed leader a letter titled the Bethesda Declaration, a frontal challenge to ""policies that undermine the NIH mission, waste public resources, and harm the health of Americans and people across the globe.""

It says: ""We dissent.""

In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, more than 90 NIH researchers, programme directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter — and their careers on the line.

They went public in the face of a ""culture of fear and suppression"" they say President Donald Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. ""We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,"" the declaration says.

Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world's premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.

It addresses the abrupt termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.

In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.

In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyse the work, the letter says.

""Ending a $5 million research study when it is 80 percent complete does not save $1 million,"" it says, ""it wastes $4 million.""

Signers say they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya's own Great Barrington Declaration of October 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.

The mask comes off

The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya but also sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH, was endorsed by 250 anonymous employees of the agency besides the 92 who signed.

Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Senator Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.

At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organiser of the declaration.

""I want people to know how bad things are at NIH,"" Norton told The Associated Press.

The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya’s own Great Barrington Declaration of October 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.

His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracised by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.

""He is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,"" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.

Cancer research is sidelined As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be.

But sudden cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimising its destruction.

""So much of it is gone — my work,"" she said.

'I don't want to be a collaborator'

The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because ""I don't want to be a collaborator"" in the political manipulation of biomedical science.

Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. ""We have a saying in basic science,"" he said. ""You go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.

""We are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,"" he added. But that won’t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing cuts to grants.

The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasised they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes or the NIH.

Dissenters range across the breadth of NIH Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.

The letter asserts that ""NIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety"" and that the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who ""braved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.""

The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.

This has forced ""indiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,"" the declaration says.

The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.

Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.

A Signal group became the place for participants to sort through NIH chatter on Reddit, discern rumor from reality and offer mutual support. The declaration took shape in that group and as word spread neighbour to neighbour in NIH offices.

The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.

With that in place, he said in a statement in April, ""NIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.""

Now it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.

""There's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,"" said Norton, who has three young children. ""I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.

""Maybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,"" she added. ""And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise."""

Official data from about half of the polling stations showed slightly less than 30 percent of eligible voters had cast their ballots at the end of two days of voting on Monday, far short of the 50 percent plus one of the electorate needed to make the vote legally binding.

The outcome is a blow for the coalition of centre-left opposition parties, civil society groups and the CGIL trade union behind the referendum questions, and a win for Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who strongly opposed them.

Meloni and her right-wing allies encouraged their supporters to boycott the vote. The prime minister visited a polling station in Rome on Sunday but did not cast a vote, a tactic she had indicated that she would adopt.

Opposition forces had hoped that latching on to the issues of labour rights and Italy's demographic woes could help them challenge Meloni, something they have struggled to do since she came to power in 2022.

""The opposition wanted to turn the referendum into a vote on the Meloni government. The response is very clear: the government emerges from this stronger and the opposition is weaker"", said Giovanbattista Fazzolari, a cabinet undersecretary and a close aide to Meloni.

One of the five referendums was about reducing the period of residence required to apply for Italian citizenship by naturalisation to five years from 10 years, which according to organisers would have affected about 2.5 million people.

In a country suffering a sharp decline in the birth rate, some economists believe attracting more foreigners is vital to boosting an anaemic economy, while rights groups campaigned for a ""Yes"" vote to promote the integration of migrant workers.

The other four referendum questions concerned a reversal of labour market liberalisations introduced a decade ago, and a broadening of liability rules on accidents at work for companies relying on contractors and subcontractors.

""Whether just above 30 percent or just below 30 percent, this is a low figure, below the expectations and targets set by the promoters,"" YouTrend's Lorenzo Pregliasco told Italian news channel SkyTG24.

According to data analysis late on Sunday by the YouTrend polling agency, turnout was higher in wealthier northern and central regions and in larger cities, and lower in the less developed south.

A higher turnout was also observed in areas where leftist parties performed well in the last general elections and in the 2024 European elections, YouTrend said."

""Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS,"" Trump stated in a post on Truth Social on Monday. In another post, he ordered the immediate arrest of anyone wearing a mask.

Trump stated the police chief reported increasingly aggressive protesters and a need to reassess the situation, urging immediate action.

Tensions in Los Angeles escalated on Sunday night as thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to Trump's deployment of the National Guard, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd.

Roughly 300 National Guard members arrived in the city over the weekend, and Trump said he had authorised 2,000 members to deploy if needed. This appears to be the first time in decades that a state’s National Guard was activated without a request from its governor.

Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, told MSNBC that he planned to file suit on Monday against the Trump administration to roll back the Guard deployment, which he called ""an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.""

Trump has cited a legal provision that allows him to mobilise federal troops when there is ""a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.""

Starting Sunday morning, the troops stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted ""shame"" and ""go home."" After some closely approached the guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.

Minutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 freeway until state patrol officers cleared them from the roadway by late afternoon.

Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently as the electric vehicles burned.

By Sunday evening, police had issued an unlawful assembly order shutting down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.

Flash bangs echoed out every few seconds into the evening.

APTOPIX Immigration Raids Los Angeles

Many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and making arrests of people who don't leave.

Some of those remaining threw objects at police from behind a makeshift barrier that spanned the width of a street and others hurled chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles.

Officers ran under an overpass to take cover.

The unrest in Los Angeles has become a flashpoint in Trump's signature effort to clamp down on irregular immigration.

The Republican president has pledged to deport record numbers of people who are in the country irregularly and to lock down the US-Mexico border, setting the ICE border enforcement agency a daily goal of arresting at least 3,000 migrants.

City Police Chief Jim McDonnell told a media briefing on Sunday evening that people had a right to protest peacefully but the violence he had seen by some was ""disgusting"" and the protests were getting out of control.

Police said they had arrested 10 people on Sunday and 29 the previous night, adding arrests were continuing.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said that the Pentagon is prepared to mobilise active-duty troops ""if violence continues"" in Los Angeles, saying Marines at nearby Camp Pendleton were on high alert.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed the Trump administration for inciting tension by sending in the National Guard.

She also condemned protesters who became violent. ""I don't want people to fall into the chaos that I believe is being created by the administration completely unnecessarily,"" she told a press conference.

Vanessa Cardenas, head of the immigration advocacy group America's Voice, has accused the Trump administration of ""trumping up an excuse to abuse power, and deliberately stoke and force confrontations around immigration.""

About 60 people were arrested in San Francisco, police said late on Sunday.

San Francisco police ""declared an unlawful assembly,"" they said on social media platform X. ""Approximately 60 people were arrested, including juveniles.""

Demonstrators said the purpose of the troops did not appear to be to keep order, with one calling it an ""intimidation tactic.""

""You have the National Guard with loaded magazines and large guns standing around trying to intimidate Americans from exercising our First Amendment rights,"" a protester Thomas Henning told the AFP news agency.

The protests did not reach the size of past demonstrations that brought the National Guard to Los Angeles, including the Watts and Rodney King riots, and the 2020 protests against police violence, in which Newsom requested the assistance of federal troops.

The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice."

Since 2008, this ongoing series of civilian-led missions has positioned itself at the intersection of humanitarian activism, international law, and Middle Eastern geopolitics.

The Israeli blockade – more intense since October 7, 2023 – continues to restrict the movement of goods and people, creating a constant struggle for Gaza’s population.

The latest attempt by the coalition to reach Gaza by the British-flagged Madleen saw yet another assault by Israel on the activists late Sunday, triggering fierce condemnation by rights groups and activists.

Organised initially by the Free Gaza Movement and later by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), a global network of civil society groups, the flotillas aim to deliver humanitarian aid, break the blockade, and raise awareness of Gaza’s plight through nonviolent direct action.

Here’s a brief timeline of the Freedom Flotilla.

The Free Gaza Movement launched its first mission in August 2008 with two modest boats, Liberty and Free Gaza, carrying 44 activists and medical supplies.

They reached Gaza, marking the first international vessels to do so in decades. A second mission, Dignity, sailed later that year. These early efforts succeeded where larger diplomatic initiatives had failed, marking the first international civilian vessels to reach Gaza in decades.

The following year witnessed intensified confrontations as several vessels – including Humanity and Spirit of Humanity – attempted similar passages.

Israeli forces began systematic interceptions, detaining activists and implementing deportation procedures. These encounters illuminated Israel's enforcement mechanisms while simultaneously generating increased international media coverage of Gaza's humanitarian circumstances.

The pattern established during this period would go on to define subsequent flotilla operations, with civilian activists testing international waters, Israeli security forces responding, and each confrontation triggering global diplomatic reverberations.

May 2010 (Mavi Marmara Incident)

The most consequential flotilla mission emerged in May 2010, organised jointly by the Free Gaza Movement and Türkiye's IHH Humanitarian Relief Foundation.

This unprecedented coalition assembled six vessels, including the flagship Mavi Marmara, carrying approximately 700 activists representing 40 nations alongside 10,000 tons of humanitarian supplies.

On May 31, 2010, Israeli naval commandos conducted a predawn raid on the flotilla while positioned in international waters.

The confrontation resulted in nine activist fatalities, with a tenth individual dying from injuries subsequently. The raid also produced dozens of wounded activists and ten injured Israeli soldiers.

Mavi Marmara sparked global condemnation, severely straining Türkiye-Israel diplomatic relations. The attack prompted Israel to ease certain blockade restrictions while simultaneously triggering multiple international investigations.

Freedom Flotilla II, also called “Stay Human” , was conceived to commemorate the 2010 raid's anniversary.

However, this 2011 mission encountered unprecedented obstacles before reaching international waters.

Only two ships – MV Saoirse and MV Tahrir – managed to sail under the ""Freedom Waves to Gaza"" banner. Israeli forces intercepted both vessels approximately 50 miles from Gaza, detaining activists and implementing standard deportation procedures.

Freedom Flotilla III launched from Sweden in May despite the previous setbacks. The mission's flagship vessel Marianne was intercepted by Israeli forces in international waters, with the ship diverted to Ashdod port and activists detained.

The mission exemplified the flotilla’s resilience from spontaneous activism toward more systematic organisational structures, even as operational challenges persisted.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition's 2018 ""Just Future for Palestine"" mission deployed four vessels, including Al Awda and Freedom.

Israeli forces boarded and seized both ships on July 29 and August 3, 2018, arresting activists who subsequently reported physical abuse, including tasering and beatings.

This mission coincided with deteriorating conditions in Gaza, lending additional urgency to activists' calls for international intervention in the blockade's humanitarian impacts.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition's Handala: For the Children of Gaza mission adopted a different strategic approach, sailing across European ports to raise awareness about Gaza's prolonged siege.

The vessel faced systematic delays due to port restrictions and flag withdrawals, which organisers attributed to Israeli diplomatic pressure.

This mission made it clear that Gaza’s children were among the main victims of the blockade’s humanitarian toll.

The most recent flotilla missions have been encountering several obstacles.

On May 2, the vessel Conscience – carrying about 12 crew members and 4 civilians and humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies, suffered two drone attacks off the coast of Malta. The attack caused significant hull breaches and fires, requiring emergency maritime rescue operations.

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition blamed Israeli forces for the attack, describing it as a shift in aggression marked by the use of unmanned aerial systems instead of the usual naval interception.

The subsequent Madleen mission—named after Gaza's first fisherwoman, Madleen Culab—departed from Catania, Sicily, on June 1.

The Madleen carried essential humanitarian supplies such as baby formula, flour, diapers, medical kits, and prosthetics for children.

The mission's stated objectives encompassed both immediate humanitarian relief and the establishment of a long-term aid corridor independent of traditional diplomatic routes.

On June 5, Israeli forces intercepted the Madleen approximately 160 kilometres from Gaza's coastline, diverting the vessel to Israeli ports following established precedent. On Sunday, Israel kidnapped a total of 12 activists aboard the Madleen, as UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese who reported hearing Israeli soldiers in the background before the phone line was abruptly cut.

“I lost connection with the captain as he was telling me that another boat is approaching,” she added.

Each mission of the Flotilla tests the boundaries of international law and sparks political consequences far beyond the Mediterranean.

These voyages represent a sustained resistance against a siege that has left Gaza increasingly isolated.

Despite repeated interceptions and state pressure, the coalition has sustained its efforts, reflecting how organised civilian action can break through diplomatic inertia.

This momentum is now expanding beyond the sea. A large-scale Maghreb land convoy is set to depart from Tunisia today, with thousands expected to join in the effort to break the Israeli siege by road and reaffirm solidarity with Palestinians under blockade.

The numbers in Gaza lay bare the consequences of a blockade that continues to restrict movement, goods, and medical supplies.

As of May 2025, 1.95 million people—93 percent of the population—face crisis-level food insecurity or worse. Around 500,000 are at immediate risk of starvation.

Legal opinions on the blockade remain divided.

A 2011 UN report backed Israel’s stance, but the UN Human Rights Council experts have declared it “excessive and unreasonable” and the International Court of Justice said it’s a form of collective punishment that violates international law.

Israel claims its blockade is aimed at stopping arms shipments to Hamas, offering to redirect aid through its own ports – an option flotilla organisers reject as politically compromised and inadequate.

The 2010 Mavi Marmara attack remains a turning point. Israel’s later agreement to pay $20 million in compensation to victims' families acknowledged the cost of that confrontation, though it did not end the broader campaign.

Missions like the Madleen continue despite risks, carrying urgently needed supplies including baby formula, flour, diapers, medical kits, and prosthetics for children.

Each journey is both a delivery of aid and a rejection of policies that have turned Gaza into what many describe as an open-air prison.

The flotilla’s persistence keeps Gaza on the international agenda, and its voyages challenge the legitimacy of a blockade that has pushed nearly an entire population into humanitarian collapse."

""We see in Ukraine how Russia delivers terror from above, so we will strengthen the shield that protects our skies,"" Rutte was due to say in a speech to the Chatham House think-tank in London, according to comments quoted in a statement on Monday.

To maintain credible deterrence and defence, he was to say that NATO needs ""a 400-percent increase in air and missile defence"".

His comments come ahead of a NATO summit in the Netherlands this month where US President Donald Trump is pressuring alliance members to announce a major boost in their military budgets.

Trump is pushing NATO members to increase their defence spending to five percent of their gross domestic product (GDP), up from the current target of two percent.

US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said last week in Brussels that the allies were close to an agreement on the five-percent target, which could be formalised at the summit in The Hague.

NATO members have been scrambling to bolster their defence capabilities since Russia launched its war against Ukraine in February 2022.

""Danger will not disappear even when the war in Ukraine ends,"" Rutte was to say.

""We need a quantum leap in our collective defence... We must have more forces and capabilities to implement our defence plans in full.""

""Our militaries also need thousands more armoured vehicles and tanks, millions more artillery shells.""

Rutte will visit London next week, where he is expected to welcome Britain's new defence strategy.

Britain announced plans last week to build up to 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines and six munitions’ factories to rearm the country in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Russia slams NATO 'aggression'

Russia has slammed NATO as an ""instrument of aggression"" ahead of an expected call from the alliance's chief Mark Rutte for a 400-percent increase in air defence spending.

NATO ""is demonstrating itself as an instrument of aggression and confrontation"", Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told on Monday reporters when asked about the plans, which Rutte was scheduled to announce in a visit to London on Monday."

A Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng is due to meet US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer at an undisclosed location in the city.

The talks are scheduled to last at least a day.

They follow negotiations in Geneva last month that brought a temporary respite in the trade war.

The two countries announced on May 12 that they had agreed to a 90-day suspension of most of the 100 percent-plus tariffs they had imposed on each other in an escalating trade war that had sparked fears of recession.

Since then, the US and China have exchanged angry words over advanced semiconductors that power artificial intelligence, “rare earths” that are vital to carmakers and other industries and visas for Chinese students at American universities.

President Donald Trump spoke at length with Chinese leader Xi Jinping by phone last Thursday in an attempt to put relations back on track.

Trump announced on social media the next day that trade talks would be held on Monday in London.

The UK government says it is providing the venue and logistics but is not involved in the talks.

“We are a nation that champions free trade and have always been clear that a trade war is in nobody’s interests, so we welcome these talks,” the British government said in a statement."

Monday’s phone call was the first contact between the two leaders since Lee took office on Wednesday.

The two leaders are expected to discuss the possibility of their first face-to-face meeting, with Ishiba emphasising the importance of dialogue and cooperation as ""partners"" in addressing global challenges.

Ishiba is expected to attend the G7 meeting beginning on Sunday in Canada. While South Korea is not a member of the G7, the presidential office has announced that Lee has accepted Canada's invitation to participate in the multilateral huddle.

Despite obstacles stemming from Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, ties between Tokyo and Seoul significantly improved under the administration of Lee's predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, who was ousted over his aborted martial law attempt in December.

A trial of President Lee

Meanwhile, a Seoul court said on Monday it will indefinitely postpone a trial of President Lee on charges of violating election law in 2022.

South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in May, before Lee was elected, that Lee had violated election law by publicly making ""false statements"" during his 2022 presidential bid, and sent the case back to an appeals court.

The Seoul High Court, which had scheduled a hearing for the case on June 18, said on Monday that it will postpone the hearing ""to be decided later"" without a date, a court spokesperson confirmed.

Lee's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The court said its decision to postpone the hearing was due to ""Constitution Article 84"", without elaborating.

South Korea's Constitution, Article 84, says a sitting president is ""not subject to criminal prosecution while in office"" for most crimes.

However, legal experts are divided on whether that applies to ongoing trials that were already prosecuted before a president was elected.

The National Court Administration under the Supreme Court gave as its opinion that judges of each court where Lee's trials are being held will have to decide whether to stop or proceed, according to its statement to a lawmaker in May.

""The court in charge of hearing the case will determine whether Article 84 of the Constitution should be applied to a criminal defendant who was elected in the presidential election,"" the statement said.

Lee's ruling Democratic Party, which controls parliament, is planning to pass a bill this week that suspends ongoing trials for the incumbent president, local broadcaster KBS reported on Monday.

The Constitutional Court may be asked to rule whether the bill is unconstitutional, legal experts have said."

""In light of these incidents and credible threats of continued violence, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby call into Federal service members and units of the National Guard under 10 USC 12406 to temporarily protect ICE and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions, including the enforcement of Federal law, and to protect Federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations,"" Trump said in a statement.

National Guard members arrived in Los Angeles overnight, with more protests planned for Sunday.

To the extent that protests or acts of violence directly prevent the enforcement of laws, they represent ""a form of rebellion"" against the authority of the government, Trump added.

He said he authorised and instructed the secretary of defence to work with governors and the National Guard Bureau to identify and activate the necessary National Guard members and units under the directive.

""The members and units of the National Guard called into Federal service shall be at least 2,000 National Guard personnel and the duration of duty shall be for 60 days or at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense,"" he said.

""In addition, the Secretary of Defense may employ any other members of the regular Armed Forces as necessary to augment and support the protection of Federal functions and property in any number determined appropriate in his discretion,"" he said.

In a post on Truth Social, the president lauded the National Guard's ""great job"" in Los Angeles following two days of violence and unrest.

""We have an incompetent Governor (Newscum) and Mayor (Bass) who were, as usual (just look at how they handled the fires, and now their VERY SLOW PERMITTING disaster. Federal permitting is complete!), unable to handle the task.

""These Radical Left protests, by instigators and often paid troublemakers, will NOT BE TOLERATED,"" Trump noted, adding that masks will now be prohibited at protests.

""What do these people have to hide, and why,"" he questioned, while also expressing gratitude to the National Guard for its handling of the situation.

More than a dozen people were arrested Saturday in confrontations between protesters and federal agents, according to US Attorney Bill Essayli.

Rioting, obstructing justice not acceptable

US Vice President JD Vance said on X that one of the major legal questions in the immigration court battles is whether former President Joe Biden's border crisis qualifies as an ""invasion.""

Vance stated: ""So now we have foreign nationals with no legal right to be in the country waving foreign flags and assaulting law enforcement. If only we had a good word for that...""

He noted that anyone breaking the law or interfering with law enforcement will face strict prosecution.

Peaceful protest is acceptable, but ""rioting and obstructing justice"" are not, Vance added, addressing what he called the ""far left rioters.""

President Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, told NBC News that California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass could be arrested if they impede immigration operations.

“Help us take these criminals off the street. Stop applauding the protesters and support law enforcement,” Homan said. “Gov. Newsom should be on the phone thanking President Trump for making a state safer.”

Homan previously said any attempt to impede ICE operations could result in arrest and accused Bass and Newsom of creating a “sanctuary for criminals.”

For his part, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also said on X that violence and destruction targeting federal agents and facilities ""will NOT be tolerated"" under the Trump administration, adding: ""It’s COMMON SENSE.""

Violent attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and federal law enforcement are deliberate attempts to obstruct the removal of criminal illegal aliens from the US, Hegseth stated, calling it ""a dangerous invasion facilitated by criminal cartels (aka Foreign Terrorist Organizations) and a huge NATIONAL SECURITY RISK.""

He added that besides the National Guard, active-duty Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton are on high alert and will also be deployed if necessary.

‘California’s feckless Democrat leaders’

A White House spokesperson said the operations are a must to ""reverse the invasion of illegal criminals into the United States.""

""In the wake of this violence, California’s feckless Democrat leaders have completely abdicated their responsibility to protect their citizens. That is why President Trump has signed a Presidential Memorandum deploying 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester,"" said Karoline Leavitt.

Stating that the Trump administration has ""a zero tolerance"" stance on criminal acts and violence, particularly when directed at law enforcement officers carrying out their duties, Leavitt warned that those responsible will be promptly arrested and held accountable.

""The Commander-in-Chief will ensure the laws of the United States are executed fully and completely,"" she said.

‘This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust’

Describing the deployment of troops as being “purposefully inflammatory,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom warned on X that it would increase tensions.

“This is the wrong mission and will erode public trust,” Newsom said.

The federal government is assuming control of the California National Guard and sending 2,000 troops to Los Angeles - not due to a lack of law enforcement, ""but because they want a spectacle,"" he noted.

""Don't give them one. Never use violence. Speak out peacefully,"" Newsom called on the protesters.

Trump had slammed Newsom in a post on X, claiming that his administration had to intervene because Newsom and the mayor of Los Angeles were unable to control the immigration protests.

“If Governor Gavin Newscum, of California, and Mayor Karen Bass, of Los Angeles, can’t do their jobs, which everyone knows they can’t, then the Federal Government will step in and solve the problem, RIOTS & LOOTERS, the way it should be solved!!!” Trump wrote on X, before announcing the signing of the memorandum.

Immigration authorities and protesters have been clashing for two days in the Los Angeles area, following unrest that began Friday after dozens were detained by immigration agents at various locations.

The arrests occurred as part of Trump’s intensified immigration crackdown, which has included widespread raids and deportations nationwide.

Over the two days, law enforcement officers in riot gear used tear gas and flashbangs to break up crowds in downtown Los Angeles and Paramount, with officials reporting multiple arrests Saturday."

Protesters, many waving red and yellow Spanish flags, massed in the Plaza de Espana, a large square in the centre of the Spanish capital, and chanted ""Perdo Sanchez, resign!"".

The Popular Party (PP) called Sunday’s rally after leaked audio recordings allegedly documented a member of the Socialist party, Leire Diez, waging a smear campaign against a police unit that investigated graft allegations against Sanchez’s wife, brother, and his former right-hand man.

Diez has denied the allegations, telling reporters on Wednesday that she was conducting research for a book and was not working on behalf of the party or Sanchez. She also resigned from Sanchez's Socialist party.

PP leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo has accused the government of ""mafia practices"" over the affair, and said Sanchez is ""at the centre"" of multiple corruption scandals.

""This government has stained everything –– politics, state institutions, the separation of powers,"" he told the rally, going on to urge Sanchez to call early elections.

The PP estimated that more than 100,000 people attended the rally, held under the slogan ""Mafia or Democracy.""

The central government’s representative in Madrid put the turnout between 45,000 and 50,000.

Sanchez has dismissed the probes against members of his inner circle as part of a ""smear campaign"" carried out by the right wing to undermine his government.

He came to power in June 2018 after ousting his PP predecessor, Mariano Rajoy, in a no-confidence vote over a corruption scandal affecting involving the conservative party.

Thirty-nine-year-old Senator Miguel Uribe was speaking to supporters in the capital when a gunman shot him twice in the head and once in the knee before being detained.

A security guard managed to detain the suspected attacker, a minor who is believed to be 15 years old.

Uribe was airlifted to hospital in ""critical condition"" and underwent a ""neurosurgical"" and ""peripheral vascular procedure,"" the Santa Fe Clinic in Bogota confirmed.

He ""overcame the first surgical procedure,"" Bogota mayor Carlos Fernando Galan told media on Sunday, adding that he had entered ""the critical hours"" of recovery.

His wife, in an audio recording shared with the media, said ""he came out well from the surgery.""

""He fought the first battle and fought it well. He is fighting for his life,"" she is heard saying.

Images from the scene of the shooting showed Uribe slumped against the hood of a white car, smeared with blood, as a group of men tried to hold him and stop the bleeding.

The suspect was injured in the affray and was receiving treatment said police director Carlos Fernando Triana.

Two others — a man and a woman — were also wounded, and a Glock-style firearm was seized.

The motive for the attack is not yet publicly known. Colombia's defence minister Pedro Sanchez vowed to use law enforcement's full capabilities and offered a roughly $725,000 reward for information about who was behind the shooting.

In a video address to the nation posted on social media, President Gustavo Petro also promised investigations to find the perpetrators of the ""day of pain"".

""What matters most today is that all Colombians focus with the energy of our hearts, with our will to live ... on ensuring that Dr Miguel Uribe stays alive.""

In an earlier statement, Petro condemned the violence as ""an attack not only against his person, but also against democracy, freedom of thought, and the legitimate exercise of politics in Colombia.""

The shooting was similarly condemned across the political spectrum and from overseas, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling it ""a direct threat to democracy.""

But Rubio also pointed blame at Petro, claiming the attack was the ""result of the violent leftist rhetoric coming from the highest levels of the Colombian government.""

""President Petro needs to dial back the inflammatory rhetoric and protect Colombian officials,"" the top US diplomat said.

Uribe, a strong critic of Petro, is a member of the Democratic Center party, which announced last October his intention to run in the 2026 presidential election.

Authorities said there was no specific threat made against the politician before the incident. Like many public figures in Colombia, Uribe had close personal protection.

The country is home to several armed guerrilla groups, and powerful cartels and has a long history of political violence."

The 23-meter (75-foot) monument was erected in 1975 when Kyrgyzstan was part of the Soviet Union.

Photos appeared online on Saturday showing the statue flat on the ground after being lowered by a crane.

While many countries formerly part of the Soviet Union have moved to downplay their ties to Russia as part of efforts to reshape national identity, the monument was taken down with little public fanfare and officials in Osh framed the removal as routine city planning.

In a statement, Osh City Hall called the move “common practice” aimed at improving the “architectural and aesthetic appearance” of the area.

Officials also noted that Lenin monuments have been “dismantled or moved to other places” in Russian cities including St Petersburg and Belgorod, and said that the issue “should not be politicised.”

The monument, they said, will be replaced by a flagpole, as was the case when a different Lenin statue was relocated in the capital, Bishkek.

The move came a week after Kyrgyzstan’s ally Russia unveiled a monument to brutal Soviet dictator Josef Stalin at one of Moscow’s busiest subway stations."

But apparent low public awareness risks rendering the vote invalid if turnout is not high enough.

Campaigners for the change in the citizenship law say it will help second-generation Italians born in the country to non-European Union parents better integrate into a culture they already see as theirs.

Italian singer Ghali, who was born in Milan to Tunisian parents, urged people to vote in an online post, noting that the referendum risks failure if at least 50 percent plus one of the eligible voters don't turn out.

“I was born here, I always lived here, but I only received citizenship at the age of 18,’’ Ghali said, urging a yes vote to reduce the residency requirement from 10 to five years.

The new rules, if passed, could affect about 2.5 million foreign nationals who still struggle to be recognised as citizens.

The measures were proposed by Italy’s main union and left-wing opposition parties.

Premier Giorgia Meloni has said she would show up at the polls but not cast a ballot — an action widely criticised by the left as antidemocratic, since it will not help reach the necessary threshold to make the vote valid.

Lack of public debate

Rights at stake Supporters say this reform would bring Italy’s citizenship law in line with many other European countries, promoting greater social integration for long-term residents. It would also allow faster access to civil and political rights, such as the right to vote, eligibility for public employment and freedom of movement within the EU.

Activists and opposition parties also denounced the lack of public debate on the measures, accusing the governing centre-right coalition of trying to dampen interest in sensitive issues that directly impact immigrants and workers.

In May, Italy’s AGCOM communications authority lodged a complaint against RAI state television and other broadcasters for a lack of adequate and balanced coverage.

The four other referendums aim to roll back labour reforms, making it harder to fire some workers and increase compensation for those laid off by small businesses, reversing a previous law passed by a centre-left government a decade ago.

One of the questions on the ballot also addresses the urgent issue of security at work, restoring joint liability to both contractors and subcontractors for workplace injuries.

Many expected to abstain from voting Opinion polls published in mid-May showed that only 46 percent of Italians were aware of the issues driving the referendums. Turnout projections were even weaker for a vote scheduled for the first weekend of Italy's school holidays, at around 35 percent of around 50 million electors, well below the required quorum.

Some analysts note however that the centre-left opposition could claim a victory even if the referendum fails on condition that the turnout surpasses the 12.3 million voters who backed the winning centre-right coalition in the 2022 general election."

Uribe, a strong critic of Petro, is a member of the Democratic Center party, led by the influential former president Alvaro Uribe, who governed Colombia from 2002 to 2018.

Last October he announced his intention to run in the 2026 presidential election.

Bogota Mayor Carlos Galan said on X that Miguel Uribe was ""receiving emergency care"", adding that ""the shooter has been captured"".

Defence Minister Pedro Sanchez meanwhile said on X that authorities were offering a reward of around $700,000 for information leading to the capture of those behind the attack.

The military and police leadership were holding a meeting to ""devise a strategy to address the situation"", the minister said."

“Rwanda’s right to the rotating presidency, as stipulated in Article 6 of the treaty [establishing ECCAS], was deliberately ignored” with instructions from DRC, the country’s foreign ministry said on Saturday.

It cited Rwanda’s exclusion from the 22nd ordinary summit of ECCAS in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa in 2023 under the chairmanship of DRC.

The Rwandan government said the situation is a new illustration of the organisation’s “excesses” and that it no longer sees any reason to remain a member of an organisation whose functioning runs contrary to its principles and usefulness.

Meanwhile, the appointment of the new chairperson of the ECCAS, initially scheduled for Saturday’s summit, was postponed after DRC reportedly opposed the transfer of the rotational chair from Equatorial Guinea to Rwanda.

The significant move by Kigali announced at the end of the 26th ordinary summit in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, symbolises the escalating tension between Rwanda and DRC concerning the conflict in eastern DRC.

Reports said efforts by authorities earlier to try to ease tensions between Kinshasa and Kigali in closed-door meetings on the sidelines of the summit fell flat.

Rwanda’s Prime Minister Edouard Ngirente attended the summit.

DRC accuses Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebels fighting in eastern DRC, which Kigali denies.

ECCAS has criticised the rebel group and called for the “immediate withdrawal of the Rwandan forces from Congolese territory”."

In a telephone interview with NBC News, Trump declined to say what those consequences would be, and went on to add that he had not had discussions about whether to investigate Musk.

Asked if he thought his relationship with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was over, Trump said, ""I would assume so, yeah.""

""No,"" Trump told NBC when asked if he had any desire to repair his relationship with Musk.

Musk and Trump began exchanging insults this week, as Musk denounced Trump's bill as a ""disgusting abomination.""

Musk's opposition to the measure is complicating efforts to pass the bill in Congress, where Republicans hold a slim majority in the House of Representatives and Senate.

The bill narrowly passed the House last month and is now before the Senate, where Trump's fellow Republicans are considering making changes. Nonpartisan analysts estimate the measure would add $2.4 trillion to the US debt over 10 years.

Trump said on Saturday he is confident the bill would get passed by the US July 4 Independence Day holiday.

""In fact, yeah, people that were, were going to vote for it are now enthusiastically going to vote for it, and we expect it to pass,"" Trump told NBC.

Musk had deleted some social media posts critical of Trump, including one that signaled support for impeaching the president, appearing to seek a de-escalation of their public feud, which exploded on Thursday.

Trump, late on Friday, suggested a review of federal government contracts held by Musk. People who have spoken to Musk said his anger has begun to recede and they think he will want to repair his relationship with Trump."

British Foreign Minister David Lammy is the highest-profile Western official to have visited both New Delhi and Islamabad since the South Asian neighbours agreed to a ceasefire last month after their worst fighting in nearly three decades.

The latest tensions began in April, following the killing of 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir. New Delhi blamed the killings on ""terrorists"" who it alleged were backed by Pakistan. Islamabad denied the allegation.

India then attacked what it called ""terrorist infrastructure"" in Pakistan, leading to escalation from both sides until a May 10 ceasefire.

""We want the situation to be maintained, but of course we recognise fragility, particularly in the backdrop of terrorism, terrorism designed to destabilise India,"" Lammy said in an interview at the residence of the British High Commissioner in New Delhi.

""We are keen to continue to work with our Indian partners on counter-terrorism measures.""

He said he discussed the next steps with both Modi and Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, but gave no specifics.

Last year, India and Britain discussed combating the financing of terrorism, cooperation between law enforcement and judicial bodies and information sharing.

Lammy said he also discussed boosting trade between the world's fifth and sixth largest economies. The countries concluded talks for a free trade deal early last month.

""I know that Prime Minister Keir Starmer is very much looking forward to coming to India very soon to sign the free trade agreement,"" Lammy said. ""There is so much that our two nations can continue to do together.""

India hails trade deal with Britain

Meanwhile, Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar said on Saturday a trade deal with Britain was ""truly a milestone"" that will boost bilateral ties as he welcomed Lammy to New Delhi.

India and Britain struck a long-delayed free trade agreement last month after negotiations were relaunched in February.

Britain has sought to bolster trade ties across the world since it left the European Union under Brexit, a need that became more pressing after the United States unleashed a global tariff blitz that risks causing weaker economic growth.

""The recent conclusion of the India-UK FTA... is truly a milestone which will not only propel our two-way trade and investment but will also have a positive effect on other strategic aspects of our bilateral ties,"" Jaishankar said after meeting Lammy, who is on a two-day visit.

""It would also contribute to the strengthening of supply and value chains,"" he said.

The accord will slash tariffs on imports of UK goods into India, including whisky, cosmetics and medical devices.

In exchange, Britain will cut tariffs on imports of clothes, footwear and food products, including frozen prawns, from India.

Britain and India are the sixth- and fifth-largest global economies, respectively, with a trade relationship worth around 41 billion pounds ($54.8 billion) and investment supporting more than 600,000 jobs across both countries.

They hope the free-trade agreement will increase trade between them by about 25.5 billion pounds, as well as boost the British economy and wages.

Talks were relaunched in February after stalling under Britain's previous Conservative administrations.

Lammy said before his visit the deal with India was ""just the start of our ambitions""."

""Iran's intelligence apparatus has obtained a vast quantity of strategic and sensitive information and documents belonging to the Zionist regime (Israel),"" the state broadcaster said, citing informed regional sources.

The report did not include any details on the documents or how Iran had obtained them.

The intelligence reportedly included ""thousands of documents related to that regime's nuclear plans and facilities,"" it added.

Iranian intelligence agencies and other state media did not immediately comment on the report.

According to state television, ""the data haul was extracted during a covert operation,"" and included a ""vast volume of materials — including documents, images, and videos.""

The report said the data was thoroughly reviewed by Iranian authorities after being securely transferred to the country.

Iran and Israel have waged a years-long campaign of covert and overt operations against each other, ranging from cyberattacks and assassinations to drone strikes and acts of sabotage.

Tehran accuses Israel of orchestrating the killings of several of its nuclear scientists, while Israel has blamed Iran for supporting militant groups across the region and targeting Israeli interests abroad.

Western countries, led by the United States and Israel — Iran's sworn enemy and considered by experts to be the only nuclear power in the Middle East — accuse Tehran of wanting to acquire nuclear weapons.

Iran denies having such military ambitions but insists on its right to civilian nuclear power under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which it is a signatory.

The report comes amid ongoing tensions surrounding Iran's nuclear program, which Israeli leaders view as an existential threat.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has consistently expressed support for bombing Iran's nuclear infrastructure.

Last year, tensions between the two foes reached an all-time high as they exchanged direct fire amid Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.

Iran, which has made support for the Palestinian cause a key tenet of its foreign policy since the 1979 revolution, does not recognise Israel."

Ukraine, however, has firmly denied the allegations, accusing Moscow of manipulation and failing to adhere to the agreed terms.

Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s lead negotiator at the peace talks with Ukraine, said on Telegram that Moscow had launched a humanitarian operation on June 6 based on the Istanbul agreements, aiming to transfer over 6,000 bodies of Ukrainian soldiers and exchange POWs categorised as wounded, critically ill, or under the age of 25.

""The first batch of 1,212 frozen soldier corpses of Ukraine's armed forces has already arrived in refrigerated trucks at the exchange site. Additional shipments are on the way,"" Medinsky stated, adding that Ukraine had also received the initial list of 640 Russian-held POWs intended for exchange.

Medinsky claimed that despite preparations and the arrival of Russian personnel at the border, the Ukrainian delegation did not appear, and Kiev postponed the process ""indefinitely,"" citing ""rather strange"" explanations. He called on Ukraine to honour the agreement, allow the return of the fallen, and enable the return of young soldiers and officers to their families.

""Russia always keeps its promises,"" he said, urging international media to verify Russia’s readiness on site.

Ukraine swiftly rejected Moscow’s accusations. In a statement released Saturday, Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War denied any delay on its part, saying no fixed date had been finalised for the exchange.

It accused Russia of “dirty games” and “manipulations,” arguing that Moscow itself had not complied with the mutually agreed parameters of the deal. The statement did not provide specific details about the alleged discrepancies.

The conflicting narratives highlight the deep mistrust that continues to cloud negotiations between the two sides, even as limited humanitarian gestures such as POW exchanges remain critical amidst the ongoing conflict.

While Russia insists it is ready and waiting at the exchange site, Ukraine maintains that the process has been undermined by Russia's deviation from the agreed framework. There is no indication yet of when, or if, the exchange will go ahead."

Speaking to TRT World, the Chairman of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) referred to recent meetings of the country's national security officials, where the issue was discussed in detail.Bhutto-Zardari was in the US as part of Pakistan's broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi's diplomatic blitzkrieg.

The delegation comprised of former foreign ministers Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.

""I believe the last time I was in the country, the government had a meeting of its security apparatus,"" he said.""The government officials made a whole host of decisions. We declared that if this water treaty (Indus Water Treaty) was violated, then Pakistan reserves the right to pull back from the Simla Agreement … if India is going to be unilateral in its decisions.""

He made it clear, however, that no final call had been made.

""I'm not quite sure we've actually taken that decision yet. But technically, the right is reserved.""

Technically, the Simla Agreement still stands — but its future is now far from certain.

India has paused the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan following strained relations after the Pahalgam attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which New Delhi blames on Islamabad.

Pakistan has refuted the claims and called for an international investigation.

In response, Pakistan announced it would review all bilateral agreements with India — including the Simla Accord — and keep them on hold for the time being.

The government also ordered the closure of the Wagah border crossing and halted all trade with India. These moves were part of a broader diplomatic and economic freeze aimed at signalling Pakistan's anger.

Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery last month in four days of clashes, their worst fighting in decades, before agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire on May 10.

The Simla Agreement, signed in July 1972 by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi, came in the wake of the 1971 war.

It was intended to bring a measure of stability to the fractured Indo-Pakistan relationship.

Both sides agreed to settle disputes through talks and to respect the Line of Control that splits Kashmir into Pakistan and India-administered areas while working toward a final resolution.

But in recent years, many in Pakistan have questioned whether the agreement still holds weight."

Bhutto-Zardari was responding to a question regarding India's denial that Trump brokered a truce during a four-day conflict between India and Pakistan (from May 7-10), which became the most serious military crisis in decades between the two rival nuclear states of South Asia.

Trump has repeatedly mentioned his efforts, praising Pakistani and Indian leaders for agreeing to a ceasefire after his trade-leveraged intervention.

New Delhi denies Trump's truce role, while Islamabad credits the US leader.

Indian lawmaker Shashi Tharoor, leading an all-party delegation in Washington DC, has firmly denied Trump's role in brokering peace between India and Pakistan.

Tharoor said that India never sought third-party mediation.

However, Bhutto-Zardari — who was in the US as part of Pakistan's broad engagement campaign to present its perspective on the recent increase in tensions with India and counter New Delhi’s diplomatic efforts — sought to commend Trump's role in halting the conflict.

""For five days, they (Trump and his team) were up all night trying to resolve the crisis… The common decency is to appreciate and acknowledge what they've done. What I am more concerned about is that … the Indian government is worried about the political blowback.""

He accused New Delhi of trying to run away from the ceasefire commitment.

""In their attempts to, sort of, run away from the commitment about the ceasefire, they will try to sabotage President Trump's broader vision for peace in the region as articulated by the Secretary of State (Marco Rubio) that there could be a dialogue at a neutral territory to discuss all friction points.""

Bhutto-Zardari was leading the delegation comprising former foreign ministers Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir. Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt, along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Tehmina Janjua, were also part of the delegation.

During the visit, the delegation met with the US officials, UN Secretary-General, the President of the General Assembly, members of the Security Council, ambassadors of the OIC group in New York, media representatives, civil society, and the Pakistani diaspora.

Bhutto-Zardari, who flew back to Pakistan on Friday evening, said his country deeply appreciates the critical role played by the United States, especially President Trump ""who again today reaffirmed his leadership in facilitating the Pakistan-India ceasefire.""

""This marked a vital first step toward de-escalation and dialogue.

Israeli and Palestinian media have reported that the group Israel has been working with is part of a local Bedouin tribe led by Yasser Abu Shabab.

The European Council on Foreign Relations (EFCR) think tank describes Abu Shabab as the leader of a ""criminal gang operating in the Rafah area that is widely accused of looting aid trucks"".

Knesset member and ex-defence minister Avigdor Liberman had told the Kan public broadcaster that the government, at Netanyahu's direction, was ""giving weapons to a group of criminals and felons"".

""What did Liberman leak? That security sources activated a clan in Gaza that opposes Hamas? What is bad about that?"" Netanyahu said in a video posted to social media on Thursday.

""It is only good, it is saving lives of Israeli soldiers.""

Michael Milshtein, an expert on Palestinian affairs at the Moshe Dayan Center in Tel Aviv, told AFP that the Abu Shabab clan was part of a Bedouin tribe that spans across the border between Gaza and Egypt's Sinai peninsula.

Some of the tribe's members, he said, were involved in ""all kinds of criminal activities, drug smuggling, and things like that"".

Milshtein said that Abu Shabab had spent time in prison in Gaza and that his clan chiefs had recently denounced him as an Israeli ""collaborator and a gangster"".

""It seems that actually the Shabak (Israeli security agency) or the (military) thought it was a wonderful idea to turn this militia, gang actually, into a proxy, to give them weapons and money and shelter"" from army operations, Milshtein said.

He added that Hamas killed four members of the gang days ago.

The ECFR said Abu Shabab was ""reported to have been previously jailed by Hamas for drug smuggling. His brother is said to have been killed by Hamas during a crackdown against the group's attacks on UN aid convoys.""

Israel regularly accuses Hamas, with which it has been at war for nearly 20 months, of looting aid convoys in Gaza.

Hamas said the group had ""chosen betrayal and theft as their path"" and called on civilians to oppose them.

Hamas, which has ruled Gaza for nearly two decades, said it had evidence of ""clear coordination between these looting gangs, collaborators with the occupation (Israel), and the enemy army itself in the looting of aid and the fabrication of humanitarian crises that deepen the suffering of"" Palestinians.

The Popular Forces, as Abu Shabab's group calls itself, said on Facebook it had ""never been, and will never be, a tool of the occupation"".

""Our weapons are simple, outdated, and came through the support of our own people,"" it added.

Milshtein called Israel's decision to arm a group such as Abu Shabab ""a fantasy, not something that you can really describe as a strategy"".

""I really hope it will not end with catastrophe,"" he said.

Last November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war crimes against civilians in the enclave."

The President’s comments in a brief telephone call made to Politico came amid a sharp online feud over Trump’s flagship legislative proposal, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”

The bill, now before the Senate, folds in Trump’s sweeping agenda — including tax cuts and tighter immigration laws — and carries a $2.4 trillion price tag.

“The numbers are through the roof, the highest polls I’ve ever had and I have to go,” he said.

Tech mogul Musk, once a vocal supporter, publicly lashed out at the cost, prompting a bitter clash with the president.

Musk went further and endorsed Trump’s impeachment after the president said to axe billions of dollars in government subsidies and contracts for the tech billionaire’s companies.

Alarmed by the fallout, White House aides scheduled a Friday call with Musk in hopes of brokering a truce, according to Politico.

Tensions are calming down

Prominent figures like hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman stepped in to urge reconciliation, saying peace would serve the country’s interest.

“I support @realDonaldTrump and @elonmusk and they should make peace for the benefit of our great country,” Ackman wrote on X.

Musk signalled openness to dialogue, replying to Ackman’s post with, “You’re not wrong,” after days of fiery criticism online.

Inside the White House, aides pushed Trump to shift focus back to the bill’s passage rather than fueling the feud.

The president followed their advice, striking a more moderate tone in a Truth Social post that still carried a jab.

“I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress,” Trump said.

He also warned that if the bill doesn’t pass, “there will be a 68 percent tax increase,” urging support for its passage."

Musk and Trump have been exchanging increasingly pointed barbs after the tech billionaire left the administration and went on to rally opposition to Trump's massive spending and tax bill.

Trump earlier on Thursday hinted that he may retaliate against his once-close aide by cutting billions of dollars in government funding for Musk's companies.

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,"" he said in a social media post. ""I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!""

'Trump would have lost the election'

Musk said earlier that Trump would have lost the 2024 US election without his support, and suggested that it may be time for the country to establish a new political party.

""Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,"" Musk wrote on X. ""Such ingratitude.""

Musk posted a poll asking his more than 220 million followers if it is time to form a new political party in the US.

While the poll has 23 hours to conclude, nearly 83 percent of respondents said it is time.

The comments, and the apparent testing of the political waters, mark the latest escalation in the growing feud between the once-close political allies after Musk left the White House where he led Trump's government-slashing effort.

Trump said on Thursday that he is ""very disappointed"" with Musk amid the tech billionaire's campaign against the president's signature spending and tax bill.

The president suggested that Musk's criticism of his ""big, beautiful bill"" may be rooted in jealousy.

""I think he misses the place. I think he got out there and all of a sudden he wasn't in this beautiful Oval Office,"" he said.

""I'm very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden, he had a problem, and he only developed the problem when he found out that we're going to have to cut the EV mandate,"" Trump said in the Oval Office as he hosted German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

Tesla shares drop amid intensifying row The ""EV mandate"" refers to a long-standing one-time tax credit of up to $7,500 for those who purchase electric vehicles.

Shares of Tesla were sharply lower in late-day trading, with the auto manufacturer down nearly 16 percent amid the intensifying row.

Musk quickly responded with a post on X with ""whatever,"" and rebutted Trump's suggestion that he had even seen the bill before he left the White House, calling the claim ""false."" He acknowledged, however, that some of his opposition stems from the elimination of the electric vehicle tax credit.

""This bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!"" he wrote.

""Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.

""That the US and Iran are engaged in direct or indirect negotiations is a promising development, but it marks only the beginning of what could become a complex and contentious process,"" Mohsen Milani, a Professor of Politics at the University of South Florida, tells TRT World.

Milani, who is also the author of the recently released book Iran's Rise and Rivalry with the US in the Middle East, says the ongoing negotiations reflect the ""determination"" of both sides to find a peaceful resolution and avoid military confrontation.

Negotiations have so far occurred in Oman and Italy, with both parties indicating advancements towards a potential agreement.

However, things began to unravel after Steve Witkoff — US President Trump's special envoy to Iran — reportedly sent a proposal to Tehran.

The plan proposed Iran could keep low uranium enrichment for civilian uses if it closed its protected underground sites for a set time.

Oman presented Iran with the US proposal for a new nuclear deal on Saturday, having mediated talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and Witkoff.

Axios, which first reported on Witkoff's proposal, stated that under the plan, Iran would not be allowed to construct any new enrichment facilities and must ""dismantle critical infrastructure for the conversion and processing of uranium.""

Axios reported the offer also proposed a regional enrichment consortium, subject to conditions.

According to sources quoted by Axios, the US proposal would also prohibit Iran from constructing new enrichment sites and mandate the dismantling of essential uranium processing infrastructure.

Trump, Khamenei differ on enrichment

However, Trump appeared to undermine the proposal reportedly offered by Witkoff, stating that he would insist Tehran fully dismantle its nuclear enrichment programme as part of any deal to ease the sanctions.

Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei hit back on Wednesday, arguing that the US proposal was against the national interest.

""The (nuclear) proposal presented by the Americans is 100 percent against"" the ideals of the 1979 Islamic revolution, Khamenei said in a televised speech. ""Independence means not waiting for the green light from America and the likes of America.""

Khamenei said enrichment is ""key"" to Iran's nuclear programme and that the United States ""cannot have a say"" on the issue.

""If we have 100 nuclear power plants but don't have enrichment, they will be of no use to us,"" because ""nuclear power plants need fuel"" to operate, he said. ""If we cannot produce this fuel domestically, we have to reach out to the United States, which may have dozens of conditions.""

""The sensitive issue of uranium enrichment on Iranian soil is a major obstacle,"" says Milani, adding Khamenei directly connected Iran's entitlement to enrich uranium with its sovereignty and independence.

""This was a direct rebuttal to Washington's maximalist demand for zero enrichment inside Iran — a demand the US had explicitly abandoned when it signed the JCPOA in 2015.

""The ball is now in Washington's court.""

Amidst the talks, the US has unveiled new sanctions targeting Iran, even as Israel has threatened to attack Iranian nuclear sites if talks collapse.

Will Tehran capitulate to these tactics?

""It is hard to imagine Iran capitulating to maximalist demands to halt its enrichment activities. Even if — and this is a big if — Iran agrees to the idea of forming an enrichment consortium, Tehran is unlikely to abandon its indigenous enrichment activities. At this stage, both sides appear to be testing each other’s red lines and are sending out trial balloons,"" says Milani.

Tehran has long believed —and continues to believe — that Israel alone cannot destroy Iran's nuclear facilities, which are dispersed throughout the country's vast territory, he says.

""From Iran's perspective, any military strike on its nuclear infrastructure would be a joint Israeli American operation, with Israel taking the offensive role and the US managing the defensive dimension.""

US says Iran must accept proposal

Currently, Iran enriches uranium to 60 percent, exceeding the 2015 deal's 3.67 percent limit, but remains below the 90 percent needed for a nuclear warhead.

A UN report indicates Iran has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels since February.

Western governments accuse Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons. Iran maintains its programme is solely for peaceful purposes.

In 2015, Iran received international sanctions relief, contingent upon UN-monitored constraints on its nuclear activities.

In 2018, Trump reinstated US sanctions upon exiting the agreement, subsequently reinforcing them with secondary sanctions. And, Britain, France, and Germany are considering whether to trigger the sanctions ""snapback"" in the 2015 accord.

Prior to the sixth round of discussions, the US has encouraged Iran to consider Witkoff's recent proposal.

""We encourage the Iran regime to accept it. It is in their best interest to accept it. We've also been clear that the Iranian regime can never have a nuclear weapon,"" State Department Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Pigott told reporters on Thursday in Washington, DC.

""We expect to meet with the Iranians again soon."""

Maori Party co-leaders Rawiri Waititi and Debbie Ngarewa-Packer were banished from parliament for 21 days, the longest-ever suspension.

Fellow Maori Party lawmaker Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, New Zealand's youngest current MP, was suspended for seven days.

The bans stem from a haka performed during voting in November on the contentious Treaty Principles Bill, which sought to redefine the principles of a key pact between Maori and the government.

Waititi held up a noose as he rose to speak in defiance of the ban on Thursday.

""In my maiden speech, I talked about one of our (ancestors) who was hung in the gallows of Mt Eden Prison, wrongfully accused,"" Waititi said.

""The silencing of us today is a reminder of the silencing of our ancestors of the past, and it continues to happen.

""Now you've traded the noose for legislation. Well, we will not be silenced.""

Although performed on many different occasions, haka are often used as a kind of ceremonial war dance or challenge to authority.

New Zealand's foreign affairs minister Winston Peters earlier mocked Waititi for his traditional full-face Maori tattoo.

""The Maori Party are a bunch of extremists, and middle New Zealand and the Maori world has had enough of them,"" said Peters, who is also Maori.

""The one that's shouting down there, with the scribbles on his face... can't keep quiet for five seconds.""

Maipi-Clarke, 22, sparked the affair as parliament considered the highly contentious Treaty Principles Bill in November last year.

In footage widely shared around the world, she rose to her feet, ripped up the bill and started belting out the strains of a protest haka.

She was joined by Waititi and Ngarewa-Packer, who strode on to the chamber floor chanting the Ka Mate haka famously performed by the country's All Blacks rugby team.

Ngarewa-Packer was also accused of pointing her fingers in the shape of a gun at the leader of the right-wing ACT Party, David Seymour, who had proposed the bill.

The trio were hauled before parliament's powerful Privileges Committee, but refused to take part in the hearing.

Supported by New Zealand's three governing coalition parties, the bans were voted on and accepted Thursday.

Maipi-Clarke said Maori would not be silenced.

""A member can swear at another member, a member of Cabinet can lay their hands on a staff member, a member can drive up the steps of Parliament, a member can swear in Parliament, and yet they weren't given five minutes of suspension,"" she said.

""Yet when we stand up for the country's foundational document, we get punished with the most severe consequences.""

The Treaty Principles Bill sought to reinterpret New Zealand's founding document, signed between Maori chiefs and British representatives in 1840.

Many critics saw the bill as an attempt to wind back the special rights given to the country's 900,000-strong Maori population.

Parliament resoundingly voted down the bill in April."

On Wednesday, Pakistan was named vice chair of the UNSC's Counter-Terrorism Committee, a powerful body formed under Resolution 1373 in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks.

The committee, made up of all 15 members of the Security Council, oversees global efforts to implement anti-terrorism obligations, including legal and institutional reforms by member states.

In a separate development, Pakistan was also appointed to lead the committee established under UNSC Resolution 1988, which monitors sanctions enforcement against the Afghan Taliban.

This double nod from the UN comes as Pakistan serves its eighth term as a non-permanent member of the Security Council, which began on January 1.

Islamabad hailed the appointments as ""a significant diplomatic development"".

In a press release, Pakistan's Mission to the UN said the move reflected the country's ""constructive role"" at the UN and its ""internationally acknowledged"" counter-terrorism efforts.

However, the news quickly triggered a flurry of angry reactions across Indian social media.

Prominent journalists, political commentators and social media influencers—many linked to the country's ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)—voiced outrage over what they described as a troubling endorsement of Pakistan's role in security and counter-terrorism matters.

The backlash comes just weeks after tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours escalated into their most serious military exchange in recent years.

In late April, a deadly attack in India-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, mostly tourists. New Delhi blamed Pakistan-based militant groups for the attack—an allegation Islamabad strongly denied.

The resulting clashes saw the use of drones, fighter jets and heavy artillery, culminating in a ceasefire reportedly brokered by the US on May 10. Pakistan claims to have shot down Indian jets, including French-made Rafales. India had admitted to losing some jets.

Since then, India and Pakistan have actively engaged on the diplomatic front, with both countries sending high-profile delegations to various countries, including the US, in what is turning out to be a battle of narratives.

While diplomatic efforts are now focused on de-escalation, the UN appointments have added a fresh layer of contention between the two sides."

An embassy spokesperson made the comments after EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas visited the Philippine capital and voiced concern over China's activities in the busy waterway, where its claims overlap those of some Southeast Asian nations.

""The EU is not a party to the South China Sea disputes and has no right to interfere in the South China Sea differences between China and the Philippines,"" the spokesperson said in a statement on the embassy website.

The survey, conducted by Israel's private Channel 12 and published late on Wednesday, showed that Bennett's party would secure 24 out of 120 Knesset seats, followed by the Likud party led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with 22 seats and the Democratic Party led by Yair Golan with 12 seats.

The ultra-Orthodox Shas party, led by Aryeh Deri, and Yisrael Beiteinu, led by Avigdor Lieberman, would each receive 10 seats, while Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid would get 9. United Torah Judaism, led by Yitzchak Goldknopf, and Otzma Yehudit, led by Itamar Ben Gvir, would gain eight seats each.

Benny Gantz's National Unity Party would receive seven seats, while Hadash–Ta'al and the United Arab List would take five seats each.

Parties failing to pass the electoral threshold (3.25 percent of valid votes) included Religious Zionism led by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (2.8 percent), and the Balad Party (1.2 percent).

In terms of political blocs, opposition parties, excluding Arab factions, would secure 62 seats, or 72 when including all opposition groups. The current governing coalition would drop to just 48 seats.

To form a government, a candidate for prime minister must secure the support of at least 61 Knesset members.

The same poll showed that 57 percent of respondents support early elections—including 88 percent of opposition voters—while 31 percent oppose the idea, including roughly 60 percent of coalition supporters.

Asked about ultra-Orthodox participation in future governments, 33 percent of respondents said they support including Haredi parties in the next coalition, 55 percent opposed their inclusion, and 12 percent were undecided.

Regarding election priorities, 43 percent of respondents cited the failure surrounding the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel by the Palestinian group Hamas as the top issue, followed by judicial reform (20 percent), the military draft law (17 percent) and Iran (9 percent), while 11 percent were unsure.

The current Israeli government, formed at the end of 2022, is legally mandated to remain in office until the end of 2026 unless early elections are called.

Asked who is best suited to serve as prime minister, 39 percent chose Netanyahu, 22 percent preferred opposition leader Yair Lapid and 32 percent said neither.

In a separate match-up, Bennett received 39 percent support compared to 34 percent for Netanyahu, with 20 percent saying neither is suitable. Benny Gantz received 23 percent in a similar comparison against 37 percent for Netanyahu.

Bennett, who launched a new political party in early April reportedly under the temporary name ""Bennett 2026,"" has emerged as a leading challenger amid growing political crises in the current Netanyahu-led government, which is facing pressure from religious coalition partners to dissolve the Knesset over the unresolved military draft exemption for Haredim, or ultra-Orthodox Jews.

Long before starting the genocide in Gaza, Netanyahu was on trial for corruption.

In 2019, he was charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. His trial began in 2020.

In January 2023, he proposed a judicial overhaul that would limit the Supreme Court's powers. Critics of the overhaul argued that this is an attempt by Netanyahu to escape justice.

The proposed overhaul triggered mass protests across Israel on a weekly basis until October 7, 2023.

Over a year and a half into the Gaza genocide, families of the hostages, along with thousands of Israelis, accuse Netanyahu of obstructing all ceasefire deals and dragging the war, effectively preventing the return of the captives.

Netanyahu also faces an international arrest warrant for war crimes in Gaza."

The draft resolution expressed on Wednesday ""grave concern over the catastrophic humanitarian situation, including the risk of famine,"" and recalled all parties' obligations to abide by international humanitarian and human rights law.

Slovenia proposed the draft resolution on behalf of the Security Council's elected 10 members—Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Panama, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, Sierra Leone, Somalia, and Slovenia— and received 14 votes.

US Charge d'Affaires ad interim Dorothy Shea said before the vote that ""US opposition to this resolution should come as no surprise.""

""It is unacceptable for what it does say, it is unacceptable for what it does not say, and it is unacceptable for the manner in which it has been advanced,"" she added, accusing the Palestine resistance group Hamas of rejecting ceasefire deals.

""Any product that undermines our close ally Israel's security is a non-starter,"" Shea said.

She once more argued that ""Israel has a right to defend itself"" and claimed that ""it is unconscionable that the UN still has not labelled and sanctioned Hamas as a terrorist organisation.""

The US previously vetoed four Security Council draft resolutions that called for an urgent ceasefire in Gaza, marking Wednesday's resolution as the fifth veto.

The US vetoed resolutions in October 2023, December 2023, February 2024, and November 2024, while abstaining in votes on other draft resolutions.

Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, attacked the text ahead of the vote.

""This resolution doesn't advance humanitarian relief. It undermines it. It ignores a working system in favour of political agendas,"" he was to tell the council, according to remarks released by his office.

Israel has been carrying out a genocide in Gaza since October 2023. Palestinians have recorded killings of more than 54,470 Palestinians, most of them women and children.

Some 11,000 Palestinians are feared buried under rubble of annihilated homes, according to Palestine's official WAFA news agency.

Experts, however, contend that the actual death toll significantly exceeds what the Gaza authorities have reported, estimating it could be around 200,000.

Over the course of the genocide, Israel has reduced most of the blockaded enclave to ruins and practically displaced all of its population."

Speaking during a NATO defence ministers meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, Guler said that Türkiye’s contributions to both regional and global security align closely with NATO’s strategic priorities.

Guler highlighted the growing challenges to international stability, stressing that NATO must maintain unity and strategic coherence to address them effectively.

“In the face of mounting global tensions, the strength and solidarity of the alliance are more important than ever,” he said.

Ongoing commitment to regional stability

""European allies have come to the realisation during discussions with their American counterparts that President Donald Trump won’t provide the guarantees they have sought to back the Europe-led 'coalition of the willing',"" the American media outlet reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The ""reassurance"" or ""deterrence"" force, as envisioned by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron, is more than a ""peacekeeping force"". One of its main tasks would be to respond militarily to a potential Russian violation of a truce agreement.

In February, Starmer said any future security guarantee for Ukraine would require a ""US backstop"", adding, ""US security guarantee was the only way to effectively deter Russia"".

On March 2, Starmer announced the initiative involving 31 countries, led by UK and France, following 2025 London Summit on Ukraine under the motto ""securing our future"".

Bloomberg reported that the US' reluctance to provide the support sought by its European partners highlights the discord among Western allies regarding how to address Russian aggression in Ukraine.

""Despite their downgraded expectations of the potential US offer to postwar Ukraine, the UK and France remain hopeful the US will continue to provide intelligence as well as surveillance of the border between Ukraine and Russia,"" Bloomberg added, citing the sources.

European officials hope Trump would intervene if British and French troops were targeted by Russia in Ukraine. However, they doubt he'd guarantee this in writing.

""Moreover, European governments have adjusted their assessment of what's needed to deter Russia. They now believe a combination of the Ukrainian force, allied training, European troops and aircraft stationed on NATO's eastern flank and patrols in the Black Sea, is enough,"" said Bloomberg, quoting one of the people.

The operation's success relies on US support. But the Trump administration hasn't pledged assistance.

The US instead suggests Europe should manage its security and Ukraine's. A ""reassurance"" force thus tests Europe's defence commitment.

The US appreciates allies' efforts, notably France, the UK, and Germany, in forming the coalition of the willing, US Ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, stated on Wednesday.

""We are counting on all our European allies to continue taking the leadership position in contributing military resources and providing the political capital to make security guarantees a reality.""

Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent is proving a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming.

UK officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops.

Certain nations, like Italy, hesitate to commit personnel absent US backing. European resources cannot rival US weaponry, intelligence, and surveillance capabilities.

French President Macron visited Italy on Tuesday to address disagreements with Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

The leaders issued a joint statement, pledging to collaborate for a more robust Europe.

In the statement, the two leaders said their ""unwavering and unhesitating"" support for Ukraine was needed more than ever to arrive to a fair and lasting end to the war, and called for ""an ambitious change in scale"" for European defence capacities.

On the Russian war in Ukraine, Meloni has been sceptical about Macron's ""coalition of the willing"" and a Franco-British plan put forward earlier this year to send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine in the event of a peace agreement.

Deploying troops would be a decision unlikely to garner public support in Italy.

Meloni has publicly rejected the idea of sending troops to Ukraine, instead championing NATO guarantees of security.

""It's a formula that certainly deserves discussion, but the issue is that Article 5 lies at the heart of NATO’s solidarity,"" Meloni has said.

""And if Trump refuses Ukraine's entry into NATO—something we would support—it's precisely because he doesn't want to trigger Article 5 in favour of Ukraine."""

Zelenskyy told reporters that the Russian document outlining Moscow's requirements to halt its invasion amounted to an ultimatum.

The announcement came on Wednesday after Turkish Trade Minister Omer Bolat met with EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic on the sidelines of the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting in Paris, where they discussed the evolving global trade landscape and how Türkiye–EU economic ties can adapt and strengthen in response.

Dialogue to intensify in Ankara

According to the ministry, both parties agreed to convene the second meeting of the High-Level Trade Dialogue on July 1, 2025, in Ankara, with participation from the business community and civil society.

The ministerial-level mechanism aims to advance concrete cooperation proposals and resolve key trade issues, including visa-related obstacles faced by Turkish entrepreneurs in the EU’s Schengen Zone.

The agenda also covered bilateral trade priorities, developments in the Customs Union framework, and efforts to overcome mutual trade barriers — areas where notable progress has been made over the past two years.

Strong integration yields results

The Trade Ministry emphasised the importance of coordinated action between the Turkish and EU economies amid rising global protectionism and economic uncertainty.

The two sides reaffirmed their shared commitment to improving economic integration and updating the Customs Union agreement, which has served as the backbone of trade between Türkiye and the EU.

Bilateral trade has grown significantly, rising 55 percent over the past five years to reach a total volume of $220 billion by the end of 2024.

In the first five months of 2025, the EU accounted for 43.5 percent of Türkiye’s exports, underscoring the bloc’s critical role as Türkiye’s largest trade partner.

The United States “can’t do anything” regarding Iran’s nuclear activities, Khamenei said on Wednesday during a ceremony in Tehran marking the 36th anniversary of the death of Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran.

The Iranian leader said Washington’s primary demand is for Iran to forgo its nuclear industry entirely and remain dependent on the US for its energy needs.

“Our response to America’s nonsense is clear: they cannot do anything about this,” he said, dismissing US demands for a complete halt to uranium enrichment.

Since last month, Tehran and Washington have engaged in five rounds of indirect nuclear negotiations in Muscat and Rome, mediated by Oman. While both sides have acknowledged some progress, a decisive breakthrough has yet to be achieved.

Complicating the talks is the US insistence that Iran dismantle its uranium enrichment programme, a demand that senior Iranian officials, including Foreign Minister and chief negotiator Abbas Araghchi, have labelled “non-negotiable”.

In a social media post on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump reiterated his administration’s stance on Iran’s enrichment.

“The AUTOPEN should have stopped Iran a long time ago from ‘enriching’. Under our potential Agreement — WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM,” he wrote.

His comments came just days after Omani Foreign Minister Badr Al-Busaidi delivered what Araghchi described as “elements of a US proposal” aimed at clinching a nuclear agreement, the details of which remain shrouded in secrecy.

Media reports, however, indicate that the proposal might permit Iran to conduct “limited low-level uranium enrichment” on its own soil for a yet-to-be-determined period.

Adopting a defiant tone, Khamenei emphasised that national independence means “not waiting for a green or red light from the US”.

He described Iran’s nuclear industry as a “foundational industry”, highlighting the country’s success in establishing a complete nuclear fuel cycle due to the efforts of Iranian scientists over the years.

Khamenei also called for strengthening the country’s defence capabilities, describing it as “another pillar of national independence”."

In an interview with TRT Haber on Tuesday, Fidan emphasised that the war, which is now entering its fourth year, is not just between two nations, but has evolved into a global conflict due to international involvement.

Reiterating Türkiye's consistent opposition to war, he highlighted the immense human and economic toll, with over a million people killed or wounded and major cities destroyed.

Fidan highlighted Ankara’s peace efforts, including the Black Sea Grain Initiative, the Istanbul talks in 2022, and multiple prisoner exchanges.

He noted that ceasefire momentum had grown during the Trump administration, and he recalled his own high-level visits to Moscow and Kiev.

Fidan added that the June 2 meeting was held in a positive spirit, resulting in an agreement on a new prisoner exchange involving over 1,000 people.

Türkiye’s efforts for permanent peace

Documents outlining ceasefire conditions were presented by both Russia and Ukraine, and the parties exchanged views on a potential leaders’ summit, he said, noting that they also agreed on the need to reconvene for a next round of talks.

“Given the current conditions and the psychological environment shaped by war, this was the best possible meeting. The key is not to leave the table and to maintain a commitment to a ceasefire and peace. This is our advice to the parties. Whether the table is in Türkiye or elsewhere is not important. What matters is that these parties keep coming together and continue talks,” he said.

Fidan noted Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s willingness to host a potential leaders’ meeting, emphasising that Erdogan is the only leader trusted by all three sides.

“A venue can be found, but as a political leader with a global stance, tested by years of tough struggles, known for honesty, reliability, and professional institutions, no other leader qualifies,” he added.

Fidan also said that a face-to-face meeting between Russian and Ukrainian leaders will become inevitable if progress is made in future talks.

He said US aid to Ukraine under former President Joe Biden is ongoing but expected to end in a few months, after which US President Donald Trump’s decisions could alter the conflict’s dynamics.

Fight against terrorism in Syria

Fidan also addressed the newly established mechanism for combatting the Daesh terror group involving Türkiye, Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon.

He said that a few weeks ago, the Jordanian and Syrian foreign ministers were hosted in Ankara, during which a foundational decision was made to activate an intelligence and operations cell through military and intelligence delegations.

“Teams composed of members from Jordan, Syria and Türkiye have now activated the Counter-Daesh Coordination Cell. This is a significant step for regional security,” he added.

Fidan said there has been little visible progress following a March 10 integration deal between the Syrian government and the PKK/YPG terrorist group, which operates under the name SDF in Syria, but noted that significant developments are taking place behind the scenes.

He also said the US involvement in Syria, institutional developments on the ground, and Türkiye’s ongoing efforts are increasingly aligning.

“We are moving toward a framework in which Damascus, Ankara and Washington can coordinate more closely to address this threat effectively,” he added."

In his inaugural address on Wednesday, Lee said his government would seek ""strong deterrence"" against North Korean threats based on the South Korea-US alliance, but would also leave the door open to dialogue to secure peace on the peninsula.

He pledged a pragmatic foreign policy and reinforced his commitment to regional stability by boosting Seoul-Washington-Tokyo ties.

Lee also vowed to lead South Korea towards a ""renewable energy-centred society"", and implement domestic reforms aimed at addressing deepening inequality and demographic decline.

Economic challenges and tariff tensions

Lee begins his presidency at a time of growing economic pressure. His country’s steel and aluminium exports face steep 50 percent tariffs from Washington under US President Donald Trump’s expanding trade measures.

South Korea was the fourth-largest exporter of steel to the US last year. Analysts say the new administration may seek to delay negotiations, citing the abrupt power transition as a justification for more time to study how other countries, including Japan and China, are handling their trade talks with the Trump administration.

Lee has said there is ""no need to rush"" a deal, though he acknowledged trade with the US was the ""most pressing matter.""

He said that within a rapidly shifting global environment, including increased protectionism, he would pursue pragmatic diplomacy for the sake of national interests, while continuing Seoul's security cooperation with the United States and Japan.

North Korea and regional security

Lee’s approach to North Korea marks a shift from the hardline stance of his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, whose tenure saw ties with Pyongyang hit a low point.

Although his Democratic Party has a more dovish history, Lee said he would combine military deterrence with efforts to resume dialogue.

""We will heal the wounds of division and war and establish a future of peace and prosperity,"" he said.

""No matter how costly, peace is better than war.""

North Korea has declared the South an enemy state and bolstered ties with Russia, reportedly sending thousands of troops to support Moscow’s war in Ukraine.

Lee’s administration also faces pressure to navigate tensions between the US and China.

While the US remains South Korea’s key security partner, China is its largest trading partner and a longtime backer of North Korea.

Lee has advocated friendlier ties with Beijing. When asked by TIME magazine whether South Korea would come to Taiwan’s aid in the event of a Chinese attack, Lee responded, ""I will think about that answer when aliens are about to invade the Earth.""

Political reform and social issues

He has also promised to investigate the attempted suspension of civilian rule and push for constitutional amendments to prevent such moves in the future.

The new president faces urgent domestic challenges, including one of the world’s lowest birth rates, rising inequality, and a housing crisis.

Lee has pledged to shorten the work week, raise the retirement age, and expand welfare services for children, the elderly, and people with disabilities."

Lee, 61, secured more than 49 percent of the vote on Tuesday to become South Korea's 14th president, according to the Yonhap News, citing the election authority. He had, until recently, faced legal and political challenges on his path to the presidency.

The provisional voter turnout, including early and overseas ballots, stood at 79.4 percent, the highest in 28 years, according to the Korea JoongAng Daily. The last presidential election in 2022 saw a turnout of 77.1 percent.

After vote counting was finished, Lee's vote stood at 49.42 percent.

Lee defeated Kim Moon-soo of the ruling People Power Party.

South Korea's election authorities officially declared him the country's new president shortly after Kim conceded defeat.

Among the legal obstacles, which still cast a long shadow over his political future, include allegations of corruption, abuse of power, and making false statements.

The newly elected president is also facing a retrial for making false statements during his 2022 presidential campaign.

A human rights lawyer-turned-politician, he was acquitted in the case this March by an appeals court, clearing the way for his presidential run.

However, the country's Supreme Court, a few weeks before the Tuesday vote, overturned the acquittal and sent the case back to the High Court for a retrial.

Factory worker and human rights defender

Born in 1963 in a mountain village in Andong, North Gyeongsang province, the former DP leader worked at a factory in Seongnam after elementary school to support his family.

At the age of 13, Lee suffered a permanent injury to his arm after a press machine crushed his wrist in the factory where he was working.

The fifth of five sons and two daughters, Lee passed exams for high school and university in 1978 and 1980, respectively.

His parents and one of his sisters used to clean public toilets for a living.

He studied law at Chung-Ang University with a full scholarship and passed the bar exam in 1986.

Lee married his wife, Kim Hye-kyung, in 1992, and has two children with her.

He worked as a human rights lawyer for almost two decades before entering politics in 2005.

Forays into politics and a survivor

Lee joined the social-liberal Uri Party, a predecessor of the DP, and the ruling party at the time.

He served as mayor of the city of Seongnam, Gyeonggi province, between 2010 and 2018, and the provincial governor from 2018 to 2021.

Later, he was elected as a member of the National Assembly from the city of Incheon in June 2022.

Lee first tried to contest the presidential election as a DP candidate in 2017, but lost the primary to the former President Moon Jae-in.

He succeeded in securing the party's candidacy for the 2022 presidential election, but lost to Yoon by a razor-thin margin of 0.73 percent.

In January 2024, Lee survived an assassination attempt, when he was stabbed in the neck during a public event.

According to authorities, the assassination attempt aimed to stop him from becoming president.

In a recent memoir, Lee described his childhood as ""miserable,"" as his poor upbringing has drawn scorn from members of South Korea's upper class.

But his checkered political career, combined with a bullish political style, has earned him the support of middle and working-class voters.

Lee is the first president from DP to have a friendly parliament, which has the power to veto the chief executive's policies.

During his leadership of DP, the party won a majority in the 300-seat parliament last year."

In a rare diplomatic spectacle, two high-level all-party teams from Islamabad and New Delhi have descended on Washington, DC at the same time, pushing sharply divergent narratives in the aftermath of a deadly spiral in Kashmir.

Their common goal: to win over the US. Their routes, however, are anything but common.

At stake is far more than soft power. It's narrative dominance in a moment that could shape the global understanding of one of the world's most volatile geopolitical fault lines.

On April 22, gunmen in India-administered Kashmir killed 26 Indian visitors at a popular tourist site.

India, which has deployed more than 500,000 troops in the tiny but disputed Himalayan region, claimed the attack had ""cross-border"" links to Pakistan, without publicly producing any evidence to support its claim.

Pakistan denied any connection to the attack. Islamabad quickly declared it a ""false flag"" operation and called for a neutral investigation.

A shadowy group called The Resistance Front purportedly claimed responsibility, according to an unverified claim quoted by some Indian media outlets. Later, the group withdrew its claims as per media reports.

But what followed was “Operation Sindoor” — a series of Indian military strikes on what New Delhi claimed as ""terror infrastructure"" in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Islamabad reported dozens of civilian deaths from Indian strikes and readied retaliatory measures.

The Pakistani response, largely limited to drone and missile raids on Indian military sites between May 8–10, culminated in India losing an unspecified number of fighter jets and an uneasy ceasefire brokered by the US.

Now, as the guns have fallen silent, the battle has moved to the diplomatic arena. And there, both India and Pakistan have placed their bets on world capitals including Washington, DC.

In an increasingly multipolar world, Washington holds significant importance. The US has often played a key role in de-escalating crises during India-Pakistan conflicts.

Both Delhi and Islamabad know this. And in the first week of June, they have arrived with all-party delegations and talking points in tow.

India's is led by Shashi Tharoor, a former UN diplomat and current parliamentarian.

The Pakistani side is headed by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, foreign minister-turned-opposition leader with a storied surname and strategic intent.

The mission is clear: define their position.

Tharoor's nine-member delegation — which includes MPs across party lines and Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu — is touring Washington's elite: think tanks, congressional committees, senior officials, and diaspora influencers.

India's pitch is grounded in ""zero tolerance"" against what it says is ""cross-border terrorism"". Operation Sindoor, New Delhi insists, was a calibrated response — and not an act of war.

India seeks to portray a ""new normal"" in which swift, surgical retaliation does not invite escalation but establishes deterrence. And it wants America to stop hyphenating India and Pakistan in conflict narratives.

The problem? That is exactly what is happening.

Former Pakistan foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari addresses a press conference at the UN on Tuesday.

Pakistan's message: Restraint and readiness

Across town, Bhutto leads Pakistan's counter-delegation with an entirely different vocabulary.

Islamabad is highlighting ""Indian aggression"" and its dispute with New Delhi over Kashmir since 1947. It says Kashmir is a source of all tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals.

""Pakistan only ever acted in self-defence, we never initiated any violence against India,"" Bilawal said in a press conference at the UN on Tuesday. Where India calls for isolation, Pakistan pleads for engagement. And while India asserts strategic decisiveness, Pakistan insists it exercised restraint — halting its limited retaliation to prevent a regional flare-up.

The Pakistani side has already met Ambassador Dorothy Shea, the US Permanent Representative to the UN. Meetings with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, and envoys of Security Council nations are also on the books.

Bhutto and his team already gave a presentation to members of the OIC in New York on Monday.

Their agenda includes Kashmir and more. Pakistan is raising the issue of ""water terrorism"". It says India is weaponising river flows under the Indus Waters Treaty — and challenging what it calls Indian propaganda in Western capitals.

The optics are striking. Two rival delegations in the same city, at the same time, fighting parallel wars of perception. It is not a summit. It is a standoff.

Bhutto, for his part, makes a forcible pitch for Pakistan's role as a responsible regional power forced to defend itself, but doing so within the bounds of diplomacy and international law.

Neither side has had time for regional forums like SAARC or other neutral platforms in Asia. Beijing is too close to Islamabad, and India's regional footing remains uneasy.

Only Washington, they calculate, can move the needle.

US considers India to be an actor in the QUAD, a major trade player, and a counterweight to China.

Pakistan, too, is entangled in American priorities — from ""global counterterrorism cooperation"" to Afghanistan’s stability.

Despite India's post-Sindoor lobbying blitz across 33 world capitals, including in the EU, the response from Washington has been mostly tepid.

Analysts say both nations remain ""hyphenated"" in US strategic calculations and are treated as co-contenders rather than one victim and one aggressor.

That's the perception India is trying to break. That's the framing Pakistan is trying to preserve.

And while India seeks to cast the episode as a strategic one-upmanship, it is Islamabad that appears to have shaped the ceasefire optics — with President Trump almost 10 times claiming he brokered truce and stopped a nuclear war, to Delhi's quiet dismay, and a world not entirely convinced by India's victory claims.

Trump has even expressed his willingness to mediate the long-standing Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan, suggesting that a resolution may be possible to settle what he called ""a thousand years"" of dispute.

As both delegations crisscross DC, one message rings clear: South Asia's fiercest rivalry has come to the echo chambers of global diplomacy and international spotlight.Both India and Pakistan seek America's ear — and by extension, its imprimatur.

For now, Washington is listening."

""In the foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, we prioritise neighbouring countries and friends in the region,"" Araghchi told reporters upon arrival on Tuesday at Rafik Hariri International Airport.

""Our relations with Lebanon are historical, deeply rooted, and have always been friendly based on mutual respect,"" he added.

The top diplomat underlined Iran’s continued support for Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

""A friendly country supports its friends in Lebanon, but this doesn't mean interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. And, no country has the right to interfere in the affairs of any state in this region,"" Araghchi said.

Speaking during a meeting with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, Araghchi reiterated Iran’s support for Lebanon’s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, as well as Lebanese efforts to end the Israeli occupation, Lebanon’s state news agency NNA reported.

He said the Iranian support for Lebanon “comes within the framework of the good relations between the two countries and the principle of non-interference in internal politics.”

Aoun, for his part, said Lebanon looks forward to strengthening its bilateral relations with Iran.

“Dialogue is the gateway to resolving all contentious issues between countries,” he said. “Dialogue should be based on rejecting violence and escalation.”

Aoun said rebuilding Lebanon after the Israeli war is a top priority, “in cooperation with sisterly and friendly countries per applicable laws.""

Araghchi also met with Lebanese Foreign Minister Youssef Raggi to discuss bilateral relations and regional developments, according to the Lebanese minister’s office.

Raggi called the discussions “frank and direct,” saying Lebanon continues diplomatic efforts “to liberate Israeli-occupied territories, halt the ongoing Israeli violations, and reassert full state authority nationwide, including the exclusive control of arms by the state.""

He also stressed that Beirut counts on Iran's commitment to ""Lebanon's security, stability, and civil peace.”

“We have a serious racism problem,” said agency commissioner Ferda Ataman on Tuesday while presenting the annual report in Berlin. “Millions of people are more concerned about their safety than ever before.”

The Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency logged a record 11,405 complaints in 2024—the highest total since its founding.

Of these, 3,858 involved racism, antisemitism, or ethnic origin, up sharply from just 1,167 five years earlier.

Discrimination cuts across daily life

The data paints a grim picture of inequality spanning all areas of society.

More than 3,000 cases were linked to workplace discrimination, while hundreds more were connected to public institutions, education, housing, healthcare, and even the judiciary and police.

Discrimination based on disability was the second most reported category, with 2,476 cases, followed by gender (2,133), age (1,091), and religion or worldview (626).

Of the 9,057 cases covered under Germany’s General Equal Treatment Act (AGG), 43 percent were related to racism or ethnic origin.

However, Ataman pointed out that over 2,300 other complaints—many involving state bodies—fell outside the AGG’s protections.

“In Germany, people are better protected against discrimination in restaurants than in government offices,” she said, calling for urgent legal reform.

'Discrimination must have consequences'

Ataman emphasised that the rise in complaints reflects not just worsening conditions, but also greater public awareness and willingness to report. Still, she warned: “What we receive is just the tip of the iceberg.”

External studies cited in the report suggest that one in three people in Germany has experienced discrimination.

Migrants report verbal abuse, threats of deportation, and indifference to hate symbols in schools, while women continue to face significant barriers in the workplace.

Calling on lawmakers to act decisively, Ataman urged the government to strengthen the Equal Treatment Act and empower institutions to resist far-right influence.

“Illegal parking is punished more consistently than discriminating against people,” she said. “Discrimination must have consequences. We cannot afford to normalise it.”"

The parliament of the world's largest landlocked country did not pass a draft resolution on a confidence ballot, meaning Oyun-Erdene was deemed to have resigned, a parliament statement said on Tuesday.

""It was an honour to serve my country and people in difficult times, including pandemics, wars, and tariffs,"" Oyun-Erdene said after the result of the vote was known.

Oyun-Erdene, who has been prime minister since January 2021 and was re-elected in July 2024, will remain caretaker prime minister until a successor is named within 30 days.

The political upheaval comes after Mongolians last month protested for weeks in the capital Ulaanbaatar alleging corruption involving Oyun-Erdene and his family.

Oyun-Erdene did not immediate respond to requests for comment on his resignation and the corruption allegations.

Helicopter-rides, expensive ring, designer handbags and luxury car

Demonstrations erupted in the capital Ulaanbaatar on May 14 after viral social media footage revealed what appeared to be an opulent lifestyle led by Oyun-Erdene's 23-year-old son.

The videos featured scenes of a grand engagement proposal involving helicopter rides, costly jewelry, high-end handbags and a luxury vehicle, sparking outrage and questions over how such wealth was obtained.

The prime minister, who built his political image on humble, rural beginnings, faced growing scrutiny as many Mongolians struggled with surging inflation, a steep cost of living and worsening air pollution in Ulaanbaatar — a city that houses nearly half the country's population.

For nearly two weeks, demonstrators gathered daily at Sukhbaatar Square outside the Government Palace, demanding Oyun-Erdene disclose his financial records and step down from office.

Although Mongolia has operated as a parliamentary democracy since its 1991 revolution, political instability has been a recurring theme, with frequent changes in leadership and collapsing coalitions.

""There is no electricity throughout the region.""

Despite the widespread outage, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant remains operational and unaffected, TASS news agency reported, quoting an official at the facility.

This escalation follows Ukraine's recent drone attacks targeting Russian military airfields.

On Sunday, Ukraine launched a large-scale drone operation, codenamed ""Spider Web,"" striking multiple Russian airbases, including those in the Irkutsk and Murmansk regions,

The operation reportedly damaged or destroyed over 40 strategic bomber aircraft, including Tu-95 and Tu-22 models, and inflicted approximately $7 billion in damages. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the mission as a ""historic"" success

The attacks coincided with renewed peace talks between Ukraine and Russia held in Istanbul on Monday.

""The AUTOPEN should have stopped Iran a long time ago from 'enriching.' Under our potential Agreement — WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANY ENRICHMENT OF URANIUM!"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Monday.

His statement came in response to media reports suggesting that the US had presented Iran with a proposal permitting limited low-level enrichment.

According to Axios, the plan would still ban new enrichment sites and require the dismantling of key uranium infrastructure, alongside enhanced international oversight.

It would also reportedly require Iran to temporarily cut enrichment levels to 3 percent and shut down underground facilities for an unspecified duration. Above-ground enrichment would be capped at reactor fuel levels, in line with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) standards.

The deal would introduce rigorous oversight, including immediate adoption of the IAEA’s Additional Protocol, granting the agency the authority to conduct environmental sampling during inspections at both declared and undeclared sites.

Enrichment remains key point

Earlier, Iran ruled out any nuclear agreement that deprives it of enrichment.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said, “If the goal is to deprive Iran of its peaceful activities, then certainly no agreement will be reached.”

Araghchi insisted that Iran has “nothing to hide” on its nuclear programme.

“Iran has a peaceful nuclear programme... we are prepared to provide this assurance to any party or entity,” he said.

Trump seeks new dealThe fifth round of nuclear negotiations between the United States and Iran was held on 23 May in Rome, mediated by Oman.

Trump, who withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement signed by Iran and world powers, has repeatedly stated that Tehran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.

He has insisted on negotiating a new deal, one that he says would be tougher and more enforceable than its predecessor."

The results, which are not verified independently, put Lee at 51.7 percent and his conservative rival Kim Moon-soo at 39.3 percent, though the exit poll has in previous elections mostly been in line with the final results.

South Koreans headed to the polls to cast ballots in a snap presidential election triggered by the ouster of former conservative leader Yoon Suk-yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December.

The voting began at 6 am on Tuesday at 14,295 polling stations nationwide and closed at 8 pm. Hours before the voting began at 6 am local time, the candidates made their final sprint to gain voters a day ahead of the election, Yonhap News reported.

Lee Jae-myung, the presidential candidate of the main opposition Democratic Party and ruling People Power Party (PPP) candidate Kim Moon-soo converged on the capital Seoul in their final push to shore up last-minute support.

Frontrunner Lee wrapped up his campaign in Seoul with a major rally in Yeouido Park, where tens of thousands of his supporters gathered, waving blue balloons.

Recalling the December 3 martial law declaration, he called on voters “to end the insurrection through voting”.

He added: “Voting, the ultimate weapon of those who hold sovereignty, is the most powerful weapon to end insurrection,” stressing that “voting is mightier than bullets”.

The latest poll showed Lee, 61, a human rights lawyer-turned-politician, in the lead with 49.2 percent, followed by Kim, 73, a former labour minister, with 36.8 percent.

Lee Jun-seok of the conservative New Reform Party is in third place with 10.3 percent.

The snap presidential election was triggered by the impeachment and removal of former President Yoon Suk Yeol over his abortive bid to invoke martial law last December.

South Koreans living overseas have already cast their votes during a two-day early voting period that took place last week.

According to the National Election Commission, some 44.4 million people in the country of 52 million are eligible to vote."

Sunday's election followed highly contentious reforms making Mexico the only country in the world to let voters select all of their judges, including Supreme Court justices.

As officials began the long process of tallying votes, Sheinbaum hailed on Monday the ""complete success"" of an exercise she said was needed to clean up a judiciary mired in corruption.

The National Electoral Institute said around 13 percent of eligible voters took part in a poll that critics said would erode democratic checks and balances and leave judges more vulnerable to criminal influence.

The low participation rate compared with turnout of around 60 percent in presidential elections last year that Sheinbaum won by a landslide.

The veteran left-winger told Mexicans on Monday that they have ""nothing to fear.""

""Mexico is a free, democratic country — that won't change. Nothing will change, except access to justice,"" she said at her daily news conference.

Sheinbaum pushed back at claims ""that we're heading toward authoritarianism and that the president will have a lot of power because she'll control the judiciary.""

""Now the judges, magistrates and justices answer to the people,"" she said, rejecting comparisons to authoritarian states like Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua.

The leader of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Alejandro Moreno, denounced the vote as a ""farce"" and called it a ""dark day for democracy.""

The elections showed Sheinbaum's Morena party was ""willing to do anything to concentrate power. They weaken the justice system, trample on institutions, and block the way to democratic debate,"" he said.

Many voters seemed daunted by the long list of largely unknown candidates in an election for around 880 federal judges as well as hundreds of local judges and magistrates.

Another election for the remainder will be held in 2027.

Arturo Giesemann, a 57-year-old retiree, said his main reason for voting was ""the disgust I have with the current judiciary because of its corruption.""

In the western state of Jalisco, 63-year-old housewife Maria Estrada said she used her ""intuition"" because she did not know the candidates.

Hundreds of opponents of the reforms marched through Mexico City waving flags and banners with slogans including: ""Hands off our democracy"" and ""No to electoral fraud.""

The elections send the judiciary ""to its grave,"" said Ismael Novela, a 58-year-old company worker.

""It was the last counterweight we had against the totalitarianism of the executive branch.""

Rights group Defensorxs had identified around 20 candidates it considered ""high risk,"" including Silvia Delgado, a former lawyer for Sinaloa Cartel co-founder Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.

Another aspiring judge, in Durango state, spent almost six years in prison in the United States for drug crimes.

Candidates were supposed to have a law degree, experience in legal affairs and what is termed ""a good reputation,"" as well as no criminal record in Mexico.

To do a good job, voters would have had ""to spend hours and hours researching the track record and the profiles of each of the hundreds of candidates,"" said David Shirk, an expert on Mexico's justice system at the University of San Diego.

The judicial reforms were championed by Sheinbaum's predecessor and mentor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who frequently clashed with the courts before stepping down last year.

The main reason for the elections seems to be ""because Lopez Obrador had a grudge against the judges,"" Shirk said."

According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhii Tykhyi, the meeting aimed to coordinate views on the agenda items of the Ukraine-Russia negotiations.

Ukrainian delegates emphasised their commitment to peace and stressed the need for a full ceasefire, a potential summit at the leadership level, and humanitarian confidence-building measures.

“The sides coordinated positions ahead of today’s meeting between the Ukrainian and Russian delegations,” Tykhyi said on social media.

The Ukrainian delegation’s call for a “leaders’ meeting” and ceasefire comes amid ongoing diplomatic efforts, with Türkiye hosting the latest round of talks as a mediator.

Ukraine willing to ""take the necessary steps for peace""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country was willing to ""take the necessary steps for peace"", ahead of talks on Monday.

""We are ready to take the necessary steps for peace,"" he said at a meeting with NATO leaders in Lithuania, adding that if Russia undermined the Istanbul talks and there was no result then ""new sanctions are urgently, urgently needed"".

The second round of talks between the two parties is expected to take place at 1000 GMT on Monday at Istanbul’s historic Ciragan Palace.

The talks will be chaired by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and are expected to bring together senior officials from all three countries. Türkiye’s National Intelligence Organisation (MIT) Director Ibrahim Kalin is also slated to attend.

Immediately after the war broke out in February 2022, Türkiye brought Russia and Ukraine together at the same table in both Antalya and Istanbul.

In May this year, Türkiye once again succeeded in hosting the two parties for their first negotiations in more than three years of conflict. The talks were held on 16 May at Istanbul’s Dolmabahce Palace.

The two sides agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners each in the May 16 talks, to present their views on a possible ceasefire in detail, and to continue the negotiations. They announced that the prisoner swap was completed on May 25.

With international actors frequently expressed their satisfaction with the start of the process in Istanbul, the talks hosted by Türkiye also received wide coverage in the world press.

Türkiye continues mediation efforts

Türkiye has continued to work towards peace between Russia and Ukraine, with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan visiting Moscow on May 26-27 and Kiev on May 29-30.

In Moscow, Fidan met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and also held meetings with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and high-level officials.

""Russia's preference for Istanbul as the venue for direct negotiations with Ukraine is a manifestation of the common understanding of our countries aimed at establishing stability,"" Fidan said in his meeting with Lavrov.

Lavrov said they value Türkiye's reestablishment of opportunities for direct negotiations with Ukraine.

All eyes turned to Türkiye once again when Lavrov announced on May 28 that they proposed to Ukraine to hold the next round of talks in Istanbul on June 2.

He said the delegation headed by Putin's Advisor Vladimir Medinsky is ready to present a memorandum prepared by Russia “on all aspects of overcoming the root causes of the crisis” to the Ukrainian delegation and to “provide the necessary explanations” during the second round of direct negotiations on June 2 and expressed his gratitude to Türkiye.

A senior Russian official said on Sunday that Moscow has received Ukraine’s draft memorandum proposing a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

Vladimir Medinsky, Putin’s advisor and head of the Russian delegation for Monday’s Istanbul talks, confirmed the document was submitted in Ukrainian and English. He added that language was not an issue and key points had already been publicised in Western media.

Medinsky also said Russia would announce its position during the talks.

Ukrainian Defence Minister to lead delegation in Istanbul

Following his visit to Russia, Fidan paid a working visit to the Ukrainian capital Kiev.

Meeting with high-level Ukrainian officials, especially President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, he reiterated Türkiye's call for a lasting peace at a news conference with Sybiha. Referring to Türkiye's good relations with both sides, he highlighted that progress could definitely be achieved as long as they remained at the negotiation table.

Ukraine initially said that it wanted to see the memorandum prepared by Russia before the second round of negotiations.

Ukrainian President stated on Sunday that despite not receiving any ceasefire proposal from Russia, his government aims to make “at least some progress” towards peace in Istanbul.

The Ukrainian delegation will be headed by Defence Minister Rustem Umerov and include Oleksandr Bevz, advisor to the head of the Office of the Ukrainian President, Oleksandr Diakov, deputy chief of staff of the Naval Forces Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya.

US President Donald Trump has pledged to end the war both during his election campaign and after taking office.

US officials who support the negotiation process held high-level phone calls with Russian officials after the first round of talks.

Trump and Putin also spoke by phone on May 19, and Trump said it went well and announced that negotiations between Russia and Ukraine would begin immediately.

Trump argued that Russia had been moving slowly in reaching a ceasefire with Ukraine and expressed his dissatisfaction with this.

He said in a statement on his Truth Social platform on May 26 following Russian airstrikes on Ukraine that Putin has ""gone crazy.""

Russia, meanwhile, said that Trump was “not being informed enough” about Ukraine's “massive terrorist attacks” on Russian cities and Russian officials suggested that his strong statements regarding the war in Ukraine may be a result of ""emotional overload.""

Trump also criticised Zelenskyy, arguing that the Ukrainian leader did not do his country any favors by talking the way he does.

At the same time, the White House released a statement saying “it is our hope that Russia and Ukraine will engage in direct talks and negotiations next week in Istanbul. And we believe that meeting is going to take place.”

It is not yet clear whether the US will send a representative to these talks.

Conflict intensifies before negotiations

While the parties were preparing to sit at the table in Istanbul, news emerged of violent attacks late Saturday and Sunday.

On Sunday, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said its forces conducted a ""large-scale"" attack on Russia and that over 40 strategic bombers were destroyed in the strike using drones in various regions, including the Siberian region of Irkutsk, whose administrative center is more than 4,300 kilometres (2,671 miles) from the Russia-Ukraine border.

The attack targeted four airfields, including Olenya, Ivanovo, Dyagilevo and Belaya, according to the report.

Russia’s Defence Ministry also issued a statement later Sunday.

The ministry acknowledged drone attacks on five airfields across Russia including in the Murmansk, Irkutsk, Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur regions. It called the strikes “terrorist attacks” carried out by the “Kiev regime.”

The ministry said the attacks at the Ivanovo, Ryazan and Amur airfields “were repelled,” while several “pieces of aircraft” caught fire in Murmansk and Irkutsk after drone launches from areas near the airfields.

“Some participants in the terrorist attacks have been detained,” it added."

Ukraine attacked Russian nuclear-capable long-range bombers at a military base in Siberia on Sunday, the first such attack so far from the front lines more than 4,300 km (2,670 miles) away, according to pro-Russian bloggers.

Unverified video and pictures posted on social media showed Russian strategic bombers - whose purpose is to drop nuclear bombs on distance targets - on fire at the Belaya air base north of Irkutsk.

Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to her old ally India in August 2024 at the culmination of a student-led mass uprising that ended her 15-year rule, and has defied an extradition order to return to Dhaka.

""The prosecution team ... is set to submit charges against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina,"" said Gazi MH Tamim, one of the prosecutors.

Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina's government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.

The domestic International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is prosecuting former senior figures connected to the ousted government of Hasina and her now-banned Awami League party.

The prosecution of senior figures from Hasina's government is a key demand of several of the political parties now jostling for power. The interim government has vowed to hold elections before June 2026.

The hearing is expected to be broadcast live on state-owned Bangladesh Television.

Prosecutors submitted their report into the case against Hasina last month with the court on Sunday expected to open proceedings by issuing formal charges.

ICT chief prosecutor Tajul Islam said on May 12 that Hasina faces at least five charges, including ""abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy and failure to prevent mass murder during the July uprising"".

Investigators have collected video footage, audio clips, Hasina's phone conversations, records of helicopter and drone movements, as well as statements from victims of the crackdown as part of their probe.

Hasina remains in self-imposed exile in India and has defied an arrest warrant and extradition orders from Dhaka to face trial in person.

She has rejected the charges as politically motivated.

The same case is also expected to include former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun. They face similar charges.

The ICT court opened its first trial connected to the previous government on May 25. In that case, eight police officials face charges of crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters on August 5, the day Hasina fled the country.

Four of the officers are in custody and four are being tried in absentia.

The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009 to investigate crimes committed by the Pakistani army during Bangladesh's war for independence in 1971.

It sentenced numerous prominent political opponents to death and became widely seen as a means for Hasina to eliminate rivals."

Islam had been sentenced to death in 2014 for rape, murder and genocide during Bangladesh’s 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.

Jamaat-e-Islami supported Islamabad during the war, a role that still sparks anger among many Bangladeshis today.

They were rivals of Hasina’s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of the Awami League, who would become Bangladesh’s founding figure.

Hasina banned Jamaat-e-Islami during her tenure and cracked down on its leaders.

In May, Bangladesh’s interim government banned the Awami League, pending the outcome of a trial over its crackdown on mass protests that prompted her ouster last year."

“Hegseth deliberately ignored the call for peace and development by countries in the region, and instead touted the Cold War mentality for bloc confrontation, vilified China with defamatory allegations, and falsely called China a threat,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement on Sunday.

Hegseth told the Shangri-La Dialogue warned that China was “credibly preparing” to use military force to upend the balance of power in Asia.

He also accused the Chinese military of building capabilities to invade Taiwan and “rehearsing for the real deal”.

China is “strongly” dissatisfied with and firmly opposed to Hegseth’s remarks and has made “solemn representations” to the US, it said. “In fact, the US is the world’s true hegemonic power and the biggest factor undermining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.”

“In order to maintain its hegemony and advance the so-called ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy’, the US has deployed offensive weapons in the South China Sea, stoked tensions, and created instability—turning the region into a ‘powder keg’ and arousing deep concern among regional countries,” the Foreign Ministry added.

China considers Taiwan its breakaway province, whereas Taipei insists on its independence.

Beijing said that there has “never” been a problem with freedom of navigation or overflight in the South China Sea.

China has always insisted on addressing differences with relevant countries through dialogue and consultation, and on safeguarding its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in accordance with law, according to the statement.

""President (Donald) Trump has made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb,"" Leavitt said in a statement, confirming that the US proposal had been communicated to Iran.

The fifth and last round of negotiations between Tehran and Washington on Iran's nuclear programme took place on May 23 in Rome, under Oman's mediation.

Araghchi characterised that round as ""one of the most professional,"" noting that Iran clearly outlined its ""positions and principles"" during discussions.

Both sides exchanged ideas, and Al-Busaidi presented his proposals, which were taken by the two sides to their respective capitals for review.

No date has been set for a sixth round, amid widening differences about Iran's uranium enrichment.

Earlier on Saturday, Iran dismissed the latest ""baseless"" report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about its nuclear program as ""a pretext for political manoeuvring"" against the country.

The IAEA report, which was circulated to member states, said Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60 percent purity has doubled, now 408.6 kilograms, an amount the agency said could be sufficient for nine nuclear weapons if enriched further.

Tensions continue to build in the region amid reports that Israel is planning a strike against Iranian nuclear sites, despite Trump cautioning against the attack."

The call was made in a joint statement released by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry on Saturday following a Libya-related trilateral meeting in Cairo.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty, Tunisian Foreign Minister Mohamed Ali Nafti, and Algerian Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf attended the meeting as part of a tripartite neighbourhood coordination mechanism.

According to the statement: “The foreign ministers of Egypt, Tunisia, and Algeria held a meeting in Cairo within the framework of resuming the tripartite coordination mechanism to review developments in Libya and push toward the desired political solution.

""In light of the serious developments in Libya and the latest security situation in the capital, Tripoli, the ministers renewed their call for all Libyan parties to exercise maximum restraint and immediately de-escalate, in a way that ensures the safety of the Libyan people.”

The joint statement emphasised the importance of advancing Libya's political process, including unifying institutions and holding simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections.

None of the Libyan factions responded immediately to the trilateral meeting's statement.

The tripartite mechanism between Egypt, Algeria, and Tunisia was launched in 2017 but was suspended in 2019.

According to another statement from the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, the Cairo meeting will reactivate this joint mechanism, reflecting the three countries' commitment to supporting peace and stability in Libya.

The three countries emphasised “the urgent need to reach a resolution to the Libyan crisis and end the state of political division, to avoid further escalation, violence, terrorism, and the widening scope of conflict.”

The ministers agreed that the tripartite neighbourhood mechanism should meet regularly, with the next meeting scheduled for Algeria, followed by Tunisia, before the end of the year.

The meeting came nearly two weeks after renewed security tensions in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, involving armed clashes between the Government of National Unity forces and other armed groups, as well as political tensions marked by protests both in opposition to and in support of the unity government.

Libya continues to face political division between two rival governments since 2022, the internationally recognised administration of Dbeibeh in Tripoli, and a parallel government led by Osama Hammad based in Benghazi, supported by the eastern-based parliament.​​​​​​​

UN-led efforts to hold national elections remain stalled, prolonging the oil-rich country's decade-long conflict and instability."

The Pentagon chief made the remarks on Saturday at an annual security forum in Singapore as the administration of US President Donald Trump spars with Beijing on trade, technology, and influence over strategic corners of the globe.

China's embassy in Singapore blasted the speech, accusing Washington of escalating tensions in the region and ""profiting from creating risks of war"".

Trump has launched a trade war with China since taking office in January, has sought to curb its access to key AI technologies and deepened security ties with allies such as the Philippines, which is engaged in escalating territorial disputes with Beijing.

""The threat China poses is real and it could be imminent,"" Hegseth said at the Shangri-La Dialogue attended by defence officials from around the world.

Beijing is ""credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific"", he said.

Hegseth warned that the Chinese military was building the capabilities to invade Taiwan and ""rehearsing for the real deal"".

China has ramped up military pressure on Taiwan and held large-scale exercises around the island that are often described as preparations for a blockade or invasion.

The United States was ""reorienting toward deterring aggression by communist China"", Hegseth said, calling on US allies and partners in Asia to swiftly upgrade their defences in the face of mounting threats.

Hegseth described China's conduct as a ""wake-up call"", accusing Beijing of endangering lives with cyber attacks, harassing its neighbours, and ""illegally seizing and militarising lands"" in the disputed South China Sea.

Beijing claims almost the entire waterway, through which more than 60 percent of global maritime trade passes, despite an international ruling that its assertion has no merit.

It has clashed repeatedly with the Philippines in the strategic waters in recent months, with the flashpoint set to dominate discussions at the Singapore forum, according to US officials.

As Hegseth spoke in Singapore, China's military announced that its navy and air force were carrying out routine ""combat readiness patrols"" around the Scarborough Shoal, a chain of reefs and rocks Beijing disputes with the Philippines.

Hegseth's hard-hitting address drew a critical reaction from the Chinese embassy in the city-state.

""The speech is steeped in provocations and instigation,"" the embassy wrote on its Facebook page.

""Mr Hegseth repeatedly smeared and attacked China and relentlessly played up the so-called 'China threat',"" the statement said, accusing the United States of being the ""biggest troublemaker"" in the region.

Beijing did not send any top defence ministry officials to the summit, dispatching instead a delegation from the People's Liberation Army National Defence University led by Rear Admiral Hu Gangfeng.

Without referring to Hegseth by name, Hu said of his speech that ""these actions are essentially about stirring up trouble, creating division, inciting confrontation, and destabilising the Asia-Pacific"".

Hegseth's comments came after Trump stoked new trade tensions with China, arguing that Beijing had ""violated"" a deal to de-escalate tariffs as the two sides appeared deadlocked in negotiations. The world's two biggest economies had agreed to temporarily lower eye-watering tariffs they had imposed on each other, pausing them for 90 days.

Reassuring US allies, Hegseth said the Asia-Pacific region was ""America's priority theatre"", pledging to ensure ""China cannot dominate us -- or our allies and partners"".

He said the United States had stepped up cooperation with allies including the Philippines and Japan, and reiterated Trump's vow that ""China will not invade (Taiwan) on his watch"".

However, he called on US partners in the region to ramp up spending on their militaries and ""quickly upgrade their own defences"".

""Asian allies should look to countries in Europe for a newfound example,"" Hegseth said, citing pledges by NATO members including Germany to move towards Trump's defence spending target of five percent of GDP.

""Deterrence doesn't come on the cheap."""

The move signals easing tensions between the neighbouring countries, as relations between the Taliban authorities and Pakistan — already rocky — have cooled in recent months, fuelled by security concerns and a campaign by Islamabad to expel tens of thousands of Afghans.

Pakistan's top diplomat on Friday said the charge d'affaires stationed in Kabul would be elevated to the rank of ambassador, with Kabul later announcing its representative in Islamabad would also be upgraded.

""This elevation in diplomatic representation between Afghanistan & Pakistan paves the way for enhanced bilateral cooperation in multiple domains,"" the Aghan foreign ministry said on X.

Kabul's Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is due to visit Pakistan ""in the coming days"", ministry spokesman Zia Ahmad Takal said.

Muttaqi met with Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar in May in Beijing as part of a trilateral meeting with their Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.

Wang afterwards announced Kabul and Islamabad's intention to exchange ambassadors and expressed Beijing's willingness ""to continue to assist with improving Afghanistan-Pakistan ties"".

Dar hailed the ""positive trajectory"" of Pakistan-Afghanistan relations on Friday, saying the upgrading of their representatives would ""promote further exchanges between two fraternal countries"".

Only a handful of countries — including China — have agreed to host Taliban government ambassadors since their return to power in 2021, with no country yet formally recognising the administration.

Russia last month said it would also accredit a Taliban government ambassador, days after removing the group's ""terrorist"" designation."

In a 2-1 decision, the US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court injunction that halted the layoffs officially termed reductions in force (RIFs) which had been on hold since May 9.

The court found that Trump lacked the necessary congressional approval to carry out such broad personnel changes.

Senior Circuit Judge William Fletcher, writing for the majority, stated that the executive order “far exceeds the President’s supervisory powers” and emphasised that “the kind of reorganisation contemplated by the order has long been subject to Congressional approval”.

The lawsuit, brought by a coalition of federal employees and labour groups, challenged the administration’s efforts to restructure nearly every Cabinet-level department, including the departments of Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Justice, Interior, Labor, State and Treasury.

The coalition praised the court’s decision, calling it “a victory in our efforts to pause these harmful actions while our case moves forward”.

In response, White House spokesman Harrison Fields criticised the ruling, saying, “A single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch.” He pledged that the administration would continue its legal fight.

The ruling follows an earlier decision by US District Judge Susan Illston, who also found that Trump lacked the authority to carry out mass layoffs without legislative backing.

The Trump administration had appealed to the 9th Circuit after the district court’s injunction, and earlier sought intervention from the Supreme Court, which declined to take up the case."

Western governments have long suspected Iran of seeking to develop a nuclear weapons capability to counter widely suspected but undeclared arsenal of its arch-foe Israel.

""If the issue is nuclear weapons, yes, we too consider this type of weapon unacceptable,"" Araghchi, Iran's lead negotiator in the talks, said in a televised speech on Saturday. ""We agree with them on this issue.""

Iran has held five rounds of talks with the United States in search of a new nuclear agreement to replace the deal with major powers President Donald Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.

The two governments are at odds over Iran's uranium enrichment programme, which Washington has said must cease but which Tehran insists is its right under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Nonetheless, Trump said Wednesday that ""we're having some very good talks with Iran"", adding that he had warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against striking its nuclear facilities as it would not be ""appropriate right now"".

Israel has repeatedly threatened military action, after pummelling Iranian air defences during two exchanges of fire last year.

Musk is leaving his position spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, and he'll be rededicating himself to running his businesses, including electric automaker Tesla, rocket company SpaceX and social media platform X.

Trump credited Musk with “a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington"" and said some of his staff would remain in the administration. Musk, who wore all black including a T-shirt that said “The Dogefather,” nodded along as the president listed contracts that had been cut under his watch.

“I think the DOGE team is doing an incredible job,"" Musk said after accepting a ceremonial key from the president. ""They're going to continue to be doing an incredible job.”

He left a searing mark on the federal bureaucracy, including thousands of employees who were fired or pushed out.

Some government functions were eviscerated, such as the US Agency for International Development, which had provided a lifeline for impoverished people around the world.

Boston University researchers estimate that hundreds of thousands of people have already died as a result of the USAID cuts.

Despite the upheaval, Musk also fell far short of his goals.

After promising to cut $1 trillion or even $2 trillion in federal spending, he lowered expectations to only $150 billion in the current fiscal year.

It's unclear whether that target has been hit. The DOGE website tallies $175 billion in savings, but its information has been riddled with errors and embellishments.

Trump said Musk had led the “most sweeping and consequential government reform effort in generations.""

He suggested that Musk is “really not leaving” and “he's going to be back and forth” to keep tabs on what's happening in the administration.

Musk, the world's richest person, recently said he would reduce his political donations. He was Trump's top donor in last year's presidential campaign.

Trump appeared eager to end Musk's service on a high note.

“This will be his last day, but not really, because he will, always, be with us, helping all the way,"" Trump wrote on social media on Thursday evening. ""Elon is terrific!""

As a special government employee, Musk's position was designed to be temporary. However, he had speculated about staying “indefinitely,” working part time for the administration, if Trump still wanted his help.

Musk has brushed off questions about how DOGE would continue without him, even suggesting it could “gain momentum” in the future.

“DOGE is a way of life,” he told reporters recently. “Like Buddhism.”"

The temporary legal status given to 532,000 people from those countries was granted under the Biden administration, starting in 2022, and included permission for them to temporarily live and work in the United States.

The so-called CHNV, or Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan, parole program was implemented, in part, to alleviate the surge of immigrants arriving at the US-Mexico border.

It allowed people who passed a security check to enter the US legally and stay for two years, as long as they had a sponsor who could provide housing.

But the Supreme Court lifted the lower court order that kept those humanitarian parole protections in place, and in a separate case, the nation's highest court also allowed the government to revoke the temporary legal status of another 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants.

US District Judge Indira Talwani from the state of Massachusetts originally ruled that the Trump administration could not sweep away each person’s status without an individualised determination.

The Supreme Court disagreed, and even though Friday's order is not a final ruling, it means that the protections for more than half a million immigrants from those four countries will not remain in place while the lawsuit proceeds.

Liberal Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor dissented, with Jackson writing that the court failed to take into account ""the devastating consequences of allowing the government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending.""

""I am confident this step would further contribute towards enhanced engagement, deepen Pak-Afghan cooperation in economic, security, CT (counterterrorism), and trade areas, and promote further exchanges between two fraternal countries,"" said the Pakistani top diplomat.

Pakistan's special representative to Afghanistan, Mohammad Sadiq, said the new step would ""promote bilateral cooperation in all fields to the benefit of their two peoples and peace and progress of their region.""

Pakistan's diplomatic mission in Kabul was until now headed by a chargé d'affaires.

The Taliban returned to power in Kabul in August 2021, after the fall of the Western-backed regime, as all the US-led foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan. No UN member has recognised the Taliban interim administration.

Islamabad's decision to upgrade ties with the appointment of a full ambassador comes after an informal trilateral meeting of top diplomats hosted by Beijing last week.

Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed in principle to appoint ambassadors as soon as possible, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said after talks with Muttaqi and Dar.

Speaking to Anadolu Agency at the Black Sea and Balkans Security Forum 2025, he underscored that Türkiye's geopolitical position and capabilities make it an essential partner for lasting peace and stability in a volatile region.

""A European Union without Türkiye is very incomplete,"" Alpay said. ""Without Türkiye, the security of the European Union and Europe is under great potential threat.""

Alpay urged the EU to fully recognise Türkiye's contributions to its security. ""The European Union needs to act in an embracing and inclusive manner and abandon its old habits,"" he said.

This sentiment mirrors consistent high-level calls from Ankara. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called Türkiye’s participation in European defence ""essential,"" while Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan recently said a sustainable security architecture ""is only possible with Türkiye’s participation.""

Alpay emphasised Türkiye's proactive stance on international partnership, particularly with Europe.

He underlined Türkiye’s potential in defence technologies and called on European countries to cooperate.

""We are ready for much closer cooperation with Europe on this matter. We can evaluate our capabilities and potential together,"" said Alpay.

In parallel to Alpay’s comments, a new comprehensive strategy for the Black Sea unveiled on Wednesday by the EU stressed ""a coordinated approach with Türkiye, an EU partner of strategic importance and a candidate country, is also crucial.""

Alpay's remarks come as the EU reconsiders its security posture amid signals of shifting US commitments.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has criticised European nations for underfunding defence, urging greater investment in national capabilities.

Similarly, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that Europe should not assume a continued US presence, calling for more burden-sharing among allies.

Türkiye's role in non-spillover of Russia-Ukraine war to sea Alpay said that Black Sea stability should be maintained through regional ownership by littoral states, particularly by NATO members Türkiye, Romania, and Bulgaria.

He said these countries should lead in addressing regional challenges, guided by international law, particularly the 1936 Montreux Convention, which regulates passage through the Turkish Straits.

Türkiye's position as a reliable mediator

Alpay underlined the importance of the convention and said Türkiye's commitment to it was demonstrated following the start of the Russia-Ukraine war.

He said that Ankara officially identified the situation as a ""war"" just four days after the operation began, subsequently invoking Article 19 of the Convention to close the Istanbul and Canakkale Straits to warships of belligerent parties.

""The non-spillover of the war to the sea has been a result of Türkiye's extraordinary diligence,"" Alpay said.

Looking forward, Alpay cautioned against further militarisation in the Black Sea, stating that additional military measures would ""do nothing but further increase tension,"" calling for international dialogue.

He said Türkiye desires ""a permanent and definitive peace"" between Moscow and Kyiv, adding that Ankara “does not think a temporary ceasefire will solve much.”

A trusted peacemaker Türkiye's position as a reliable mediator continues to shape its regional diplomacy. Ankara’s mediation between Ethiopia and Somalia, and contribution to peacebuilding through trilateral cooperation between the Serb, Croat, and Bosnian communities in Bosnia-Herzegovina are some examples of this role.

Lately, Istanbul hosted Russia-Ukraine peace talks on May 16, the first direct high-level negotiations since the early months of the war. The warring parties agreed to swap 1,000 prisoners of war from each side, and Russia proposed the second round of talks to be held in Istanbul again on June 2.

Alpay attributed the international community's trust in Türkiye's role as a facilitator for peace to its consistent, “just, and equitable” approach.

He further elaborated that ""the warring countries, as well as other countries participating in these negotiations, found Türkiye's … adherence to international law and its obligations under international law from the very beginning as very noteworthy.""

Türkiye will keep contributing to peace by leveraging its potential and engaging role in regional cooperation, Alpay said."

It’s the million-dollar question right now in the South Asian nation of 170 million people – and the lightning rod that is roiling the transitional government led by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus.

Yunus was installed as the head of the interim government following the ouster of an ostensibly pro-India government of Sheikh Hasina last August.

Bangladesh has seen sporadic protests over the past few weeks, with striking civil servants and schoolteachers clashing with the police and paramilitary forces.

One of the main reasons for the growing discontent is the timing of the proposed general election.

The interim government wants to delay the polls until June 2026. But key stakeholders, including the powerful military and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former premier Khaleda Zia, want a general election by December.

Analysts say an interim government fighting a two-pronged battle against the military and political parties is ‘unprecedented’ in Bangladesh.

“We have never seen the interim government having a tussle with the military and a major political party simultaneously… an open tussle between a (caretaker) government and the military is unprecedented,” Zahed Ur Rahman, a Dhaka-based academic and political commentator, tells TRT World.

Bangladesh army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman muddied the waters recently by saying that elections should be held by December.

The interim government snubbed the army chief by pointing out his failure to maintain “jurisdictional correctness”.

“The army can't meddle in politics. In today's world, no military of a civilised nation engages in politics,” a cabinet member was quoted as saying.

Bangladesh has been in political turmoil since a student-led revolt toppled the Hasina government after three weeks of protests in which 1,400 people died.

Yunus has been hailed as the “lone stabilising force” who represents Bangladesh’s best chance to pull things together until a fair election is held.

The interim government vowed to institute governance reforms and purge the political system of sympathisers of Hasina’s Awami League party, which ruled Bangladesh from 2009 to 2024 with an iron fist.

“There is a widespread perception that the government, through the newly appointed national security adviser, tried to create a situation in which the current military chief could be fired. This further escalated the tension,” says Rahman.

Except the supporters of the Awami League, most Bangladeshis supported Yunus ‘strongly’ in the initial days of the interim government, he says.

The military is not interested in taking over power as it keeps talking about a swift democratic transition, Rahman insists. But that hasn’t stopped some people, especially in urban areas, from raising questions over the military airing its views on political issues, he adds.

Why BNP wants early election

Supporters of the BNP held large-scale protests against the interim government last week for the first time.

The party expects a clear victory in the next polls as its archrival, Awami League, has recently been banned from taking part in the electoral process.

Abul Hasan, an international affairs analyst from Bangladesh currently working at Russia’s National Research University, tells TRT World that the Hasina regime ‘politicised’ every segment of society in its 16-year reign.

The mandate of the Yunus-led government is to hold free and fair elections “by implementing necessary reforms” and holding trials for the perpetrators of the “July-August (2024) genocide”.

“The government should announce a specific timeline for the election,” he says, adding that not doing so may worsen the political situation.

Hasan blamed Indian media for spreading disinformation to create unrest in Bangladesh.

Critics accuse Yunus of delaying elections only to cling to power. Yunus has warned his detractors of mobilising public support to counter “unreasonable demands” from the army and political parties.

Meanwhile, the National Citizen Party, born out of last year's deadly student-led protests, insists elections must wait until key reforms are completed.

Another point of contention in the ongoing political crisis in Bangladesh is a proposed humanitarian corridor from the Bangladeshi city of Cox’s Bazar to the neighbouring Myanmar’s Rakhine state to help the Rohingya community.

Bangladesh is hosting in Cox’s Bazar more than 1.3 million Rohingya refugees who fled military crackdowns in Myanmar in August 2017.

The UN-backed humanitarian corridor is supposed to be used for aid distribution in the conflict-hit area. Myanmar’s junta blocked all supplies to corner the Arakan Army rebel group in Rakhine state, where the UN says up to two million people face the dire prospect of famine.

But the Bangladeshi army has opposed the project, citing risks to Dhaka’s sovereignty and potential foreign interference from the US and the UN.

The army called it a bloody corridor, leading Yunus to backtrack after military pressure.

“It is possible that the Bangladesh Army and the BNP are facing pressure from New Delhi, which may have compelled them to oppose the humanitarian corridor and ask for an immediate election,” says Hasan.

“The behaviour of the BNP and the army chief is questionable.”"

Japan pledged $1.063 billion in budget assistance, railway upgrades and grants to Bangladesh, while also confirming the transfer of five patrol boats to the Navy under its Official Security Assistance program, Yunus' press team said on Friday.

The two leaders expressed hope for the early finalisation of a defence equipment and technology transfer deal.

As part of economic cooperation, Japan’s government and private sector committed to hiring at least 100,000 Bangladeshi workers over the next five years, under a new memorandum of understanding signed on Thursday.

Full support to Yunus government

Yunus is in Tokyo for a four-day visit, including participation in the 30th Nikkei Forum Future of Asia.

His delegation also discussed Japanese investment in major infrastructure, including a deep seaport and projects under the Bay of Bengal Industrial Growth Belt initiative.

The two countries also affirmed their joint position on the Rohingya refugee crisis, stressing the need for a “sustainable, safe, voluntary and dignified” repatriation of displaced Rohingya to Myanmar.

Bangladesh hosts more than 1.3 million Rohingya in its southeastern Cox’s Bazar region, most of whom fled a Myanmar military crackdown in August 2017.

On the other hand, Ishiba Shigeru also reiterated his country's full support to Muhammad Yunus-led interim government in its nation-building efforts, reform initiatives, and endeavour towards a peaceful transition in Bangladesh, The Daily Star reported.

The country is battling to draw a line under months of political turmoil sparked by Yoon's suspension of civilian rule, for which he was impeached and stripped of office.

Since then the Asian democracy has been led by a revolving door of lame duck acting presidents as its export-driven economy grapples with trade turmoil abroad and sluggish demand at home.

All major polls have placed liberal Lee Jae-myung as the clear front-runner in the presidential race, with a recent Gallup survey showing 49 percent of respondents viewed him as the best candidate.

Trailing behind him is conservative ex-labour minister Kim Moon-soo of the ruling People Power Party — Yoon's former party — at 35 percent.

While election day is set for June 3, those who want to vote early are allowed to do so on Thursday and Friday.

As of 8:00 am on Friday (2300 GMT Thursday), a record 21 percent had voted out of 44.4 million registered voters, Seoul's National Election Commission said.

Overseas voting in particular reached a historic high, with four out of five of the 1.97 million eligible voters casting their ballots last week.

The Asian nation of about 52 million people are choosing a new president who will lead it for the next five years.

Whoever succeeds Yoon will have to grapple with a deepening economic downturn, some of the world's lowest birth rates and a soaring cost of living.

He will also have to navigate a mounting superpower standoff between the United States, South Korea's traditional security guarantor, and China, its largest trade partner.

But analysts see martial law as the defining issue in the presidential race.

Kang Joo-hyun, a political science professor at Sookmyung Women's University, told AFP news agency the high turnout ""naturally reflects the public's strong desire to restore democracy in South Korea"".

""Overseas Koreans... more than ever, felt compelled to make their voices heard through the ballot, driven by a sense that the very foundations of South Korea's democracy were being shaken,"" said Kang.

Lee lost his 2022 bid for the presidency to Yoon by one of the smallest margins in South Korean history, with one of the main debates becoming gender issues.

The former school dropout rose to political stardom partly by highlighting his humble beginnings.

He has vowed to ""bring insurrection elements to justice"" if elected president.

Seoul National University political science professor Kang Won-taek warned, however, that South Korea's political woes were far from over.

""There is a real possibility that the political turmoil and crises we've seen could re-emerge,"" said Kang.

Lee, the frontrunner, has been a ""central figure in the polarisation that has fuelled much of the country's political instability"", he said.

""Unless he adopts a markedly more inclusive approach to governance, there's a strong chance that past conflicts will resurface."""

""Ukraine is ready to attend the next meeting, but we want to engage in a constructive discussion. This means it is important to receive Russia's draft,"" said Andriy Yermak, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff.

It was not immediately clear whether the statement constituted an official condition for Ukraine's attendance.

The call came as the United Nations warned that hopes for peace in the three-year-old war were ""barely"" alive, and the United States reiterated that it may withdraw from mediation efforts and impose further sanctions on Russia.

Ukraine's statement published on Thursday followed Russian claims that it was still awaiting confirmation from Kiev regarding participation in a new round of talks in Istanbul on Monday.

Diplomatic efforts have accelerated in recent months, but Russia has continued its heavy bombardment of Ukrainian territory and rejected calls for an immediate ceasefire.

Moscow has offered to hold a second round of direct talks in Istanbul on June 2, where it said it would present a ""memorandum"" outlining its terms for a long-term peace settlement.

However, Ukraine has maintained that the meeting would be pointless unless it receives a copy of the memorandum in advance.

Responding to the demand, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Ukraine's insistence on seeing the document ahead of the talks was ""non-constructive"".

Ukraine, in turn, said it had already submitted its own peace framework and expected Moscow to do the same.

""Russia is doing everything they can to make the meetings empty,"" Zelenskyy said. ""And this is another reason why there must be sufficient sanctions, sufficient pressure on Russia.""

Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Georgiy Tykhy suggested Moscow's refusal to share its document ""suggests that it is likely filled with unrealistic ultimatums.""

Erdogan says do not 'shut the door'

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is expected to host the next round of talks, urged both sides not to ""shut the door"" on dialogue.

The last direct talks, held in Istanbul on 16 May, led only to a prisoner exchange and vague pledges to remain in contact.

Russia said it planned to send the same delegation as before, led by Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky, according to Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.

Following the May talks, Ukraine accused Moscow of making unrealistic demands, including calls for territorial concessions in areas still under Ukrainian control.

Meanwhile, the United States told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that its proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine was ""Russia's best possible outcome"" and President Vladimir Putin should take the deal.

The US wants Russia to agree to a comprehensive 30-day land, air, sea and critical infrastructure ceasefire.

""We want to work with Russia, including on this peace initiative and an economic package. There is no military solution to this conflict,"" Acting Deputy US Ambassador John Kelley told the Security Council.

""The deal on offer now is Russia's best possible outcome. President Putin should take the deal.""

Civilian deaths in Ukraine jump

The UN's top officials meanwhile warned of a dramatic rise in civilian casualties in Ukraine this year, calling for an immediate ceasefire and urgent humanitarian assistance amid the escalating conflict.

""In total, since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, at least 13,279 civilians, including 707 children, have been killed. The confirmed number of civilians injured stands at 32,449, including 2,068 children,"" Rosemary DiCarlo told a Security Council session on Ukraine.

The parliament of Republika Srpska (RS), one of two entities making up Bosnia since its 1990s war, had passed the laws in February after a Sarajevo court convicted Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik for failing to comply with decisions of the international envoy who oversees the peace deal that ended the war.

Dodik was sentenced to one year in prison and banned from holding political office for six years. Dodik and the prosecutors have appealled and new hearing is to be held in June.

But Dodik initiated the laws, which include a ban on Bosnia's central police and judiciary from operating in the Serb entity.

Bosnia's central government has been strengthened over the years to the detriment of the semi-autonomous powers in Republika Srpska and the Muslim Bosniak-Croat federation, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH). The changes include the creation of a central police and judiciary.

Bosnia's Constitutional Court said Thursday that legislation adopted by Bosnian Serbs ""annul... the sovereignty of the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina over part of its territory.""

It said in a statement that only Bosnia's central parliament can decide on the return of powers to one of the regional entities.

Dodik, who as president of Republika Srpska put the controversial laws into effect, has been wanted since March by Bosnia's central judiciary for an ""attack on the constitutional order"".

The Constitutional Court also annulled a Bosnian Serb law on a special register of non-governmental organisations getting international funding to designate them as foreign agents, adopted also in February.

The court said it based its decision on a European Court of Human Rights ruling which said that similar legislation adopted in Russia was contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights."

They have often attributed this success to their federalist state structure and the belief that decentralization enhances efficiency at local and state levels.

As a result, until President Donald Trump’s second term, neither Congress nor the White House had established a federal institution like DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency).

While past presidents, from Theodore Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan, and even Vice President Al Gore, launched projects or commissions to improve federal government performance, none were as ambitious as Musk’s DOGE initiative.

After nearly 250 years of US history, DOGE finally came to life—thanks to Elon Musk, the South African–born tech magnate. But just four months into its creation, DOGE’s founding father stepped down from leadership.

Musk announced on social media that he is stepping down from his role in the Trump administration—a move the White House confirmed was underway as of Wednesday evening.

“As my term as a Special Government Employee comes to a close, I want to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to help reduce wasteful spending,” the billionaire posted on X, the platform he owns.

Elon Musk in his early happy days in the Trump administration.

Does Musk’s early departure feel incongruous with his ambitious agenda?

“The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,” Musk said on X, announcing his resignation. But if DOGE is truly destined to become integral to American governance, why did Musk not pilot it to better skies?

In a recent interview with The Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, the world’s second-richest man, Musk suggested things were not progressing as he envisioned. “DOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything,” he said, expressing dissatisfaction with his own brainchild due to various pressures coming from the Trump administration.

In another interview with CBS, he was more direct expressing his dismay and disappointment toward Trump saying that his new “big beautiful” tax bill “increases the budget deficit” and “undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.” A tax bill can not be both big and beautiful, he said. Progressives also criticise Trump’s bill for its cuts to social programs like Medicaid.

Let’s see what Musk pledged and what he delivered since the DOGE’s emergence.

At the outset, Musk promised that he would save ""at least $2 trillion"" from the federal government budget, which spent about $6.8 trillion in the fiscal year of 2024. This means Musk would cut nearly one third of the US federal spending this year.

In the early days, Musk played a key role in the departure of an estimated 260,000 federal employees by either firing or forcing resignations, which correspond to nearly one tenth of the total federal workforce. Musk became the subject of bureaucratic wrath, pulling much criticism from progressive political quarters and media alike.

As Tesla and SpaceX shares suffered due to Musk’s close association with Trump, he soon realized that his ambitious goals were unattainable within the structures of federal bureaucracy and the clashing interests of different political and social groups, which rein in the direction of both the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress.

“The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised,” he said during the Washington Post interview. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.”

Facing many uphill battles in Washington, a centre of many political intrigues, Musk reduced his projected federal savings to first $1 trillion and then to $500 billion, which was still too high for the federal government. According to DOGE’s recent estimates, Musk’s institution may have saved around $160 billion, which might still be an overstatement, experts say.

DOGE “has grossly overstated its financial savings accomplishments,” wrote David Walker, a former US Comptroller General, in a recent article, criticising Musk for his “over promised” and “under delivered” policies.

“It also has not employed a clearly defined, consistently applied and transparent process during its efforts,” which reduced the public’s confidence in the US government, increasing the partisan infighting in Washington, according to Walker.

Despite his critiques of DOGE’s conduct, Walker concedes that there was also a bright side to some of Musk’s initiatives which discovered “significant waste in the federal government”, revealing its old-fashioned operational capabilities in regard to information systems and auditing in the age of AI.

Musk’s initiatives discovered “significant waste in the federal government”, revealing its old-fashioned operational capabilities, according to David Walker, a former US Comptroller General.

But he added that most of these problems were already pointed out by federal agencies like the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and other monitoring groups.

Beside showing the federal government’s waste and its outdated mechanisms, DOGE also demonstrated to government bureaucracy and its top leaders how to use AI techniques to innovate its operations with better accountability, according to Walker.

AI also proved to be a sore point for Musk. He publicly expressed his frustration toward Trump’s pick of Sam Altman, Chief Executive of OpenAI, a leading American AI company, for the government-backed Stargate deal in January.

Musk’s disappointment only grew as Altman was made a key figure in Trump’s recent economic delegation to the Gulf region, where lucrative trade deals were sealed with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.

According to a recent Wall Street Journal report, much to Musk’s dismay, during Trump’s Gulf tour, Altman’s OpenAI led a group of technology firms to win a strategic deal “to build one of the world’s largest artificial-intelligence data centres” in UAE’s capital Abu Dhabi.

“Elon Musk worked hard to try to derail the deal if it didn’t include his own AI startup, according to people familiar with the matter,” the WSJ reported."

Noting that Syria requested the Coordination Unit to operate in Damascus, the sources said: “The Coordination Unit, composed of Türkiye, Syria, and Jordan, began its mission in Syria on May 19.”

The sources emphasised that the agreement process between the new Syrian government and the terrorist organisation PKK/YPG-led SDF is being closely monitored in terms of ensuring regional stability and security.

While all positive steps aimed at establishing peace and stability in Syria are supported, the ministry sources stated that the process must be carried out transparently and inclusively, with due consideration given to the legitimate security concerns of all parties.

“Our position on the Syrian army as a single armed structure in Syria and the integration of the SDF terrorist organisation into the Syrian army has not changed. Even if there are disruptions or delays in the process, the outcome will not change,” sources said.

“Decentralisation and separatist agendas will not be allowed in Syria in cooperation with the Syrian government,” the sources added.

Türkiye for ‘SAFE’ Europe

The ministry sources also addressed Türkiye’s potential inclusion in the Security Action for Europe (SAFE), stating that efforts to strengthen Europe’s defence capabilities have accelerated in parallel with the war in Ukraine and current global developments.

The sources noted that the SAFE Regulation, which foresees the allocation of a $170 billion (€150 billion)fund by the EU for defence procurement among member countries, was adopted by the EU Council on May 27.

The ministry sources noted that in principle, the SAFE mechanism is open to the participation of Türkiye, adding that the regulation includes several restrictive provisions concerning non-EU countries.

""Unfortunately, during this process, we have also witnessed attempts to exclude non-EU allies, including our country, from the EU’s defence and security architecture or to use them as a bargaining tool,"" the sources said.

""We believe that European security can only be strengthened through inclusiveness, strategic foresight, and collective solidarity, and that this requires a visionary approach,"" the sources added.

The ministry sources stressed that Türkiye, with its advanced defence capabilities, can make a significant contribution to European defence and security, a view also expressed by several allies during the negotiation process of the SAFE regulation.

""Within this framework, we will continue our efforts to enhance defense cooperation with open-minded and forward-looking European allies, both within and outside the SAFE mechanism, leveraging our advanced capabilities in unmanned aerial vehicles, air defence systems, armored vehicles and land platforms, electronic warfare and radar systems, ammunition and rocket systems, as well as naval systems,"" the sources added."

US District Judge Michael Farbiarz in Newark, New Jersey, said on Wednesday, he would issue a further order later in the day outlining next steps. Khalil remains in immigration detention in Louisiana.

Judge Farbiarz wrote that Khalil is likely to succeed in arguing that the provision “is unconstitutional as applied to him.”

In his detailed 27-page opinion, Judge Farbiarz criticized the provision under which the government sought Khalil’s removal — Section 212(a)(3)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act — as lacking “any clear standard” and allowing the State Department to act “without meaningful judicial oversight.” He emphasised that such sweeping executive discretion raises serious constitutional concerns, particularly when used against a lawful permanent resident like Khalil.

The ruling comes just days after Khalil was finally allowed to meet his newborn son for the first time — a moment that followed weeks of legal and public controversy. His wife had previously been denied access during an earlier visit attempt, sparking criticism from rights advocates and lawmakers.

Khalil, who has remained in detention since March, held his infant in his arms during a court-approved visit, a scene that drew emotional responses from those following his case.

Crackdown on pro-Palestine voices

Khalil was arrested on 8 March after the State Department revoked his green card using a rarely invoked provision of US immigration law that allows the secretary of state to seek the deportation of any non-citizen deemed adverse to US foreign policy interests.

His arrest was the first in a long crackdown on pro-Palestine voices in the US.

A few days after Khalil's arrest, Trump's claim came due after another pro-Palestine student, Badar Khan Suri, an Indian researcher at Georgetown University, was arrested. His attorney said he was arrested because of the Palestinian identity of his wife.

After the arrest of Suri, authorities went after another pro-Palestine student, Momodou Taal, asking him to turn himself in.

On March 25, Yunseo Chung, a Columbia University student, said she sued the Trump administration to stop her deportation from the US over her participation in a pro-Palestine protest last Spring.

Also on March 25, Rumeysa Ozturk, who is a Tufts University PhD student, was kidnapped in broad daylight by US authorities over criticising Israel's carnage in Gaza.

On April 14, authorities arrested Mohsen Mahdawi during his citizenship interview before he was released on April 30."

“I am pleased to announce that our United States Ambassador to Turkey (Türkiye), Tom Barrack, will be serving as our Envoy to Syria,” Trump wrote on Wednesday in a social media post.

“Tom understands there is great potential in working with Syria to stop radicalism, improve relations, and secure peace in the Middle East. Together, we will Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!” he added.

The announcement comes days after the US lifted what Trump described as “brutal and crippling” sanctions on Syria, imposed during the Assad era. The president said the decision followed requests from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Trump met Syrian President Ahmed al Sharaa last month in Riyadh during a visit to the kingdom — a historic sit-down marking the first meeting between US and Syrian leaders in 25 years. The last such meeting was in 2000, when former President Bill Clinton held talks with Hafez al Assad in Geneva.

“Türkiye is doing a lot for the alliance. It is the 2nd Army of the alliance. And so, we cannot disregard this,” Dragone said at a press briefing on Wednesday after the 18th Conference of the Chiefs of Staff of the Balkan Countries, held at the Multinational Joint Warfare Center in Istanbul.

He described Türkiye as “a strong pillar, a strong reference, a strong reliable ally,” noting its operational readiness and contributions to missions in conflict zones, including Kosovo, where Türkiye will assume command of NATO’s KFOR mission in October.

“So you get the sense of how important and how strong Türkiye is for us, for the alliance, and how much the alliance relies on Türkiye,” he said.

He also credited Ankara as a key facilitator in diplomacy, especially in the context of Ukraine: “Türkiye will be one of the key actors in the peace process between Russia and Ukraine.”

Turkish UAVs ‘on top’ in battlefield evolution

Dragone also praised Türkiye’s defence innovation, especially in unmanned systems.

He said Turkish-made UAVs are “on top” globally and have proven themselves in combat — not just in the air, but also in emerging applications at sea and underwater.

“Many lives are likely being saved thanks to UAVs — not only among pilots and aviators but also seamen and soldiers,” he noted.

Unmanned underwater vehicles, in particular, are helping redefine maritime operations with cost-effective deterrence and patrol missions.

While emphasising technological advancement, Dragone also urged defence industries across NATO to shift focus from profit to performance.

Aliyev emphasised that the alliance among the three nations has only deepened in the years since the war.

“The brotherhood of the three fraternal countries is growing stronger every year. We stand together in good and bad times,” he said, framing the trilateral partnership as a source of stability and cooperation in the region.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also attended the ceremony and echoed the sentiment, saying the victory in Karabakh had paved the way for a stronger and more prosperous Azerbaijan.

“The torch of independence lit on that day is illuminating the path of a much stronger Azerbaijan,” Erdogan said, adding that the region is now ready to write a “story of success, peace, and development.”

EU leaders framed the move as a step toward encouraging a political transition and national reconciliation.

The statement reaffirmed the Council’s commitment to helping the Syrian people ""reunite and rebuild a new, inclusive, pluralistic and peaceful Syria.""

Despite the easing of economic pressure, the Council extended targeted sanctions against individuals and entities linked to the ousted regime leader Bashar al Assad.

Otherwise, it would cost Canada $61 billion to participate in the system, said Trump on Tuesday, who has repeatedly suggested that the United States’ northern neighbour should become the 51st state.

Canada has expressed interest in joining the missile defence scheme — unveiled by Trump last week as a shield against a range of hostile weapons — but has firmly rejected any suggestion of surrendering its sovereignty.

“I told Canada, which very much wants to be part of our fabulous Golden Dome System, that it will cost $61 Billion Dollars if they remain a separate, but unequal, Nation,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.“But (it) will cost ZERO DOLLARS if they become our cherished 51st State. They are considering the offer!”

There was no immediate response from Canadian officials to Trump’s remarks.

Trump announced the Golden Dome initiative a week ago, stating it would cost around $175 billion and be operational by the end of his presidential term in 2029. However, experts have warned that the system faces significant technical and political hurdles and may ultimately cost far more than Trump has estimated.

Trump previously claimed Canada was keen to join the missile defence network. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney later confirmed that “high-level” discussions on the matter had taken place.

Canada and the United States are long-time defence partners through NATO and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).

Still, Trump’s proposal appears likely to inflame tensions with Ottawa. Carney firmly rejected Trump’s call for Canada to join the US as a state during his visit to the White House earlier this month, saying that Canada was “never for sale.”

Despite their differences, Carney and Trump appeared to ease some friction during the visit, particularly regarding US tariffs imposed on Canadian exports."

The report said on Tuesday that the Cabinet gave its approval two weeks ago for the establishment of the settlements in the occupied West Bank.

The decision reportedly includes plans to re-establish the illegal outposts of Homesh and Sa-Nur, both of which were dismantled in 2005 under Israel’s unilateral “disengagement plan” from besieged Gaza.

The proposal was jointly submitted by Defence Minister Israel Katz and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.

In response, the Palestinian presidency condemned the move, saying it marked “a dangerous escalation that drags the region into a cycle of violence and instability.”

Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesperson for the Palestinian presidency, said: “The Israeli government's secret approval to establish 22 new settlements in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, represents a serious escalation and a challenge to international legitimacy and international law.”

Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza in 1967. It later withdrew from Gaza in 1994 under the Oslo Accords signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and dismantled settlements there in 2005.

Earlier this month, on 12 May, the Cabinet also approved the resumption of land registration procedures in Area C of the West Bank, which is under full Israeli control and makes up about 61% of the territory.

On 19 July 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel’s continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territories is unlawful and called for the evacuation of all Israeli settlements established on occupied land. The court reaffirmed the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination."

The move follows efforts by the administration to target individuals who oppose Israeli military actions in Gaza and express support for Palestinians.

According to an internal cable seen by Reuters on Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed consular sections to pause scheduling appointments for F, M, and J visa categories while a review of current screening processes is underway.

Appointments already on the calendar may continue under current procedures, but unfilled slots are to be withdrawn.

""The Department is conducting a review of existing operations and processes for screening and vetting of student and exchange visitor (F, M, J) visa applicants, and based on that review, plans to issue guidance on expanded social media vetting for all such applicants,"" the cable said.

Support for Palestinians or criticism of Israel’s genocide in Gaza

State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to comment directly on the cable but told reporters that the US will continue to use ""every tool"" to evaluate individuals seeking entry into the country.

“We will continue to use every tool we can to assess who it is that's coming here, whether they are students or otherwise,” Bruce said at a press briefing.

The expanded vetting process will require adjustments in operations and resource allocation across consular sections globally, the cable notes.

The decision comes amid a broader administration effort to revoke visas and increase deportations as part of its hardline immigration agenda.

Trump officials have stated that foreign students and green card holders may face removal over public expressions of support for Palestinians or criticism of Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza, characterising such views as a threat to US foreign policy and as sympathetic to Hamas.

Detention of a Turkish student

A Tufts University student from Türkiye was detained in a Louisiana immigration facility for over six weeks after co-writing an op-ed criticising her university’s response to Israel’s actions in Gaza.

Rumeysa Ozturk was arrested by plainclothes ICE agents on March 25 while she was walking down the street in Somerville, Massachusetts in broad daylight. Ozturk was then quickly shuttled between three states as authorities transported her to an immigration prison in Louisiana.

She was later released after a federal judge approved her bail.

Last week, the administration moved to revoke Harvard University's authorisation to enroll new international students.

The university’s 6,800 international students represent roughly 27 percent of its total enrollment.

The administration has also taken steps to challenge Harvard’s financial and policy positions after the university resisted federal directives."

“Putin is playing with fire,” Trump wrote on Tuesday on his social media platform, Truth Social, in response to Russia’s continued air strikes on Ukrainian cities.

The strikes have intensified over the past three nights, prompting widespread international condemnation.

Trump claimed that his past diplomacy helped prevent more severe consequences for Russia during his presidency.

“If it weren’t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia — and I mean REALLY BAD,” he wrote.

‘Putin gone absolutely crazy’

The remarks follow Trump’s statement on Sunday, where he described Putin as having “gone absolutely CRAZY” after the latest wave of attacks.

Trump, who frequently touted a strong personal rapport with Putin while in office, appeared puzzled by the Russian leader’s recent actions.

“I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin, but something has happened to him,” he said.

The Kremlin quickly brushed off Trump’s comments. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the statements as “emotional overload,” suggesting they should not be taken seriously.

Meanwhile, diplomatic efforts have seen a glimmer of progress.

On May 16, delegations from Moscow and Kiev met in Istanbul—their first face-to-face talks since March 2022—and, although no ceasefire was agreed upon, they concluded a deal to swap 1,000 prisoners of war each over three days.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan played key roles as facilitators, underlining Ankara’s ambition to host and mediate future negotiations.

Despite this breakthrough, substantive peace talks remain stalled: Russia has signaled it will present a draft peace memorandum, but Kiev has rejected Moscow’s core demands—including recognition of annexed territories and a pledge of neutrality—leaving the prospects for a broader settlement uncertain"

Pezeshkian travelled to Muscat looking to promote ""peace and stability"", he said, two days after US President Donald Trump described the latest negotiations as ""very, very good"".

""We hope to engage in dialogue to reach a shared perspective and a common voice on promoting peace and stability in the region,"" Pezeshkian said in a televised speech before leaving Tehran.

Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei confirmed on Monday that the visit would address the ongoing nuclear talks.

A statement from Iran's presidency said Pezeshkian met Sultan Haitham bin Tariq and told him Tehran appreciated Oman's help in the talks, ""and we hope that this process will lead to positive results"".

Oman, Iran's neighbour across a narrow strip of sea, has since April facilitated five rounds of talks between Tehran and Washington, which do not have diplomatic relations.

Although the latest meeting in Rome on Friday ended without tangible progress, the talks were warmly received by Trump.

""I think we could have some good news on the Iran front,"" he said, adding that an announcement could come ""over the next two days"".

The United States is seeking to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons -- which Tehran denies seeking -- as the Iranians seek relief from crippling sanctions.

The talks are the highest-level contact between the countries since the United States quit a previous nuclear accord during Trump's first term.

Ahead of Pezeshkian's visit, Iran's central bank governor Mohammadreza Farzin arrived in Oman on Monday to discuss ""monetary and banking cooperation"" and commercial exchanges, Iranian media reported."

“As Türkiye and Russia, we will continue to work together to ensure that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Syria is protected,” Fidan said at a joint press conference on Tuesday following high-level talks in Moscow.

“We will intensify our efforts, making sure that the Syrian people achieve prosperity and stability.”

The two top diplomats also signalled renewed willingness to resume direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine — with both endorsing Türkiye’s role as a trusted mediator.

“We can once again appeal to our Turkish friends for the second round of negotiations with Ukraine,” Lavrov said, describing Istanbul as a “promising venue” for future dialogue.

Türkiye facilitated the first direct talks between Russia and Ukraine in three years in Istanbul on May 16, where the two sides agreed to a large-scale exchange of prisoners involving a total of 1,000 people from each side and to continue negotiations for a truce.

“Ending this war permanently is our shared goal”

The two foreign ministers met on the second day of Fidan's working visit to Moscow where he previously met with Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, leader of the Russian delegation at the Russia-Ukraine talks held in Istanbul on May 16, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Fidan once again expressed Türkiye’s readiness for hosting future negotiations between Moscow and Kiev and extended Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s support for the process.

Fidan echoed Lavrov’s readiness for future Russia-Ukraine peace talks, emphasising Türkiye’s geographical and political stake in ending the war.

“We live in the same geography… Ending this war permanently is our shared goal, and Türkiye will continue to support efforts toward that end,” Lavrov said.

On the crisis in Gaza, Fidan issued a sharp warning over the consequences of continued violence.

“The genocide in Gaza must stop at once,” he said. “Otherwise, a chaos that can engulf Israel will be unstoppable.”

Lavrov affirmed Russia’s alignment with Türkiye on the Palestinian issue. “We have common views with Türkiye on Palestine. What is happening in Gaza and the West Bank is unacceptable,” he said.

Fidan’s visit to Moscow took place on May 26–27 at the invitation of Lavrov, according to Turkish foreign ministry sources.

During the visit, Fidan was received by Russian President Vladimir Putin and held talks with Lavrov. He also met with several senior Russian officials, including presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky — who led the Russian delegation at the Russia-Ukraine talks held in Istanbul on May 16.

The Lachin International Airport is the third airport built by Azerbaijan in territories liberated during the 2020 war with Armenia.

Located at an altitude of 1,800 metres above sea level, the airport was built by carving rocks in the mountainous terrain and leveling the area. Lachin is the highest-altitude airport in Azerbaijan.

Starting its construction in 2021, the airport is 30 kilometres from Lachin city center, 70 kilometres from Shusha and 60 kilometres from Kalbajar. The airport has a runway length of 3,000 metres and is 60 metres wide, and its terminal building can serve as many as 200 passengers per hour.

Third international airport in Karabakh

With the decree signed by Azerbaijani Prime Minister Ali Asadov on May 26, Lachin Airport was granted the status of an international airport.

Information on this status was also relayed to international organisations. Thus, the number of international airports in Azerbaijan increased to nine.

Earlier, the Fuzuli International Airport, the first airport built in the regions liberated by Azerbaijan, was opened on October 26, 2021 with the participation of Erdogan and Aliyev.

Billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla sold 5,475 units of vehicle in April, ACEA's report showed, while this figure was at 11,540 units in April 2024 in the EU.

In Europe, including the EU, the European Free Trade Association, and the UK, Tesla's sales also fell by 49% to 7,261 units in April 2025, versus the same month last year.

Meanwhile, battery electric car sales soared by 34.1% to 145,341 units in the EU.

Once the standout leader in electric car sales, Tesla was overtaken in April by 10 rivals including Volkswagen, BMW, Renault and Chinese maker BYD, according to JATO Dynamics consultants.

Tesla's sales have been rapidly declining in Europe in the past few months due to the CEO Elon Musk's controversial political stance and the intervention in politics of Europe.

Hybrid domination reshapes European EV market

Skoda's new Elroq led electric car sales while Tesla's Model Y, the former frontrunner, ranked ninth.

Sales of electric cars overall rose 26.4 percent from last year to take a 15.3 percent share of the market in April, according to the ACEA.

The rise is uneven across Europe as different governments and manufacturers give different incentives to buy electric.

Germany, Belgium, Italy and Spain have seen a major rise while electric car sales in France have fallen.

Sales of hybrid cars with a small electric battery still dominate the European market, rising 20.8 percent since the start of the year, while petrol-only cars have fallen 20.6 percent over the same time.

The Volkswagen group remains the top brand in Europe, with sales up 2.9 percent in April.

But Chinese brands were a major factor in the popularity of electric and hybrid cars, according to JATO and have 7.9 percent of the European market.

The BYD, MG, Xpeng and Leapmotor brands saw sales rise 59 percent over the year in electric and hybrid sales, while other manufacturers put on 26 percent.

JATO expert Felipe Munoz said it remains to be seen whether the European Union imposes tariffs on Chinese hybrid cars as it has for electric vehicles."

US President Donald Trump announced on 20 May that he had selected a design for the Golden Dome system and appointed a leader to oversee the ambitious $175 billion programme.

Describing the project on Tuesday, the Institute for American Studies at North Korea’s Foreign Ministry said: “The Golden Dome plan is a typical product of 'America First' — the height of self-righteousness, arrogance, high-handed and arbitrary practice — and is an outer space nuclear war scenario.”

The statement was carried by North Korea’s state news agency, KCNA.

The Golden Dome project aims to utilise a global network of hundreds of satellites equipped with advanced sensors and interceptors, designed to detect and destroy enemy missiles shortly after launch — including those from countries such as China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia.

China last week expressed strong opposition to the plan, saying it is ""seriously concerned"" and urging Washington to halt development of the system."

""President Trump specifically sent me here to have a conversation with the prime minister about how those negotiations are going and how important it is that we stay united and let this process play out,"" Noem said during an interview with Fox News' ""Fox and Friends.""

""It was a very candid conversation.""

Her comments come days after Iranian and US delegations wrapped up a fifth round of talks in Rome last week, and signs of some limited progress emerged.

Trump said on Sunday that nuclear talks with Iran saw ""serious progress"" and that there will be another round of talks.

Iran rules out nuclear deal

Earlier, Iran denied discussing any interim agreement during its indirect nuclear negotiations with the US.

""If the US goal is to maintain Iran's nuclear programme as peaceful, this can be achieved. We have never sought military nuclear capabilities,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said at a news briefing in Tehran.

He, however, warned that ""if the aim is to deprive Iran of its basic rights like low-level uranium enrichment, we don't believe such negotiations would succeed.""

The spokesperson also denied international media reports suggesting that Tehran might suspend enrichment for three years to facilitate a deal with Washington.

""No, there is absolutely nothing like this on the table,"" he stressed.

Oman is mediating between Tehran and Washington to resolve key disputes over Iran's nuclear programme. Five rounds of negotiations have been held so far since last month, with three being held in Muscat.

Russian military sources and pro-Russian bloggers had reported the capture of villages in the region in recent days. Sumy has been subject to repeated air strikes since the start of Russia’s attacks.

Writing on social media on Monday, Sumy Region Governor Oleh Hryhorov named the captured villages as Novenke, Basivka, Veselivka and Zhuravka, all located near the border. He noted that residents of these villages had already been evacuated.

“The enemy is continuing attempts to advance with the aim of setting up a so-called 'buffer zone',” Hryhorov wrote.

He said Ukrainian forces were ""keeping the situation under control, inflicting precise fire damage on the enemy.""

Fighting is reportedly ongoing nearby villages, including Volodymyrivka and Bilovodiv — both of which Russia’s Defence Ministry claimed earlier on Monday were now under its control.

Ukraine’s State Emergency Service reported that one civilian was killed on Monday when Russian forces shelled an area west of the captured villages.

Sumy region lies across from Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops carried out a cross-border raid in August 2023. While Moscow says it has expelled Ukrainian troops from the area, Kiev maintains that its forces are still active there.

Over the weekend, DeepState, a well-known Ukrainian military blog, reported that Russian forces had for the first time managed to establish positions along a line of border villages in the Sumy region.

A Russian missile strike on the regional capital, also named Sumy, killed 35 people on Palm Sunday last month.

DeepState also reported on Monday that Russian forces had launched new attacks further east near Vovchansk in the Kharkiv region — an area where Moscow had opened another front in May 2024.

West lifts restrictions on weapon supplies

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Monday said Western powers have lifted range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine, allowing Kiev to strike military targets inside Russia.

“There are no longer any range restrictions on weapons supplied to Ukraine. Neither from the British, nor from the French, nor from us, nor from the Americans,” Merz said at the WDR European Forum in Berlin.

“This means that Ukraine can now also defend itself, for example by attacking military positions in Russia. It couldn't do that until a while ago. With very few exceptions, it didn't do that until a while ago either. But now it can do this,” he said.

Ukraine accuses China of supplying Russia

In other developments, Ukraine’s foreign intelligence chief on Monday claimed that China is providing supplies to military factories in Russia.

“True, information has emerged, suggesting that China supplies tooling machines, special chemical products, gunpowder, and components specifically to defense manufacturing industries,” Oleh Ivashchenko, the head of Ukraine’s Foreign Intelligence Service, told the state-run Ukrinform news agency.

Ivashchenko claimed that they have confirmed data on 20 Russian factories in this regard, adding that they have recorded at least five cases of aircraft industry cooperation between Russia and China in 2024-2025.

“As of early 2025, 80 percent of critical electronic components found in Russian drones originated in China,” he said.

“At the same time, there are facts of product substitutions, deceptive product names, there are shell companies through which everything necessary for the production of microelectronics is supplied,” he added.

Last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused China of giving direct military support to Russia, as well as announced sanctions that also targeted China-based entities, claiming they are involved in the production of Russian missiles."

Abu Qasra said the former army’s reputation was stained by abuses against civilians, and his ministry is now working to restore trust between the armed forces and the public.

“We are working to bridge the gap between the army and the people,” he said.

Abu Qasra recently paid an official visit to Türkiye alongside President Ahmad al Sharaa and the Syrian Foreign Minister, where they met with their Turkish counterparts as part of efforts to normalise relations and enhance regional cooperation.

The minister revealed that his office had engaged with around 130 armed factions and achieved “significant success” in integrating them under the ministry’s authority. He emphasised: “No group will be allowed to act outside the Defence Ministry’s authority.”

Abu Qasra said the ministry is working closely with the Interior Ministry to pursue remnants of the former Bashar al-Assad regime, seize illicit weapons, and ensure arms remain under state control. Preventing further abuses against Syrians remains a key priority.

The military is also undergoing internal reforms to enhance efficiency, reactivating officers and personnel, and restoring military educational institutions to prepare for new recruits.

Commenting on officers who defected during the previous regime, the minister said many are willing to return and contribute to rebuilding a professional force. “We are working to recruit them,” he said.

Abu Qasra reiterated the goal of forming a “professional volunteer army” rooted in loyalty to the nation, not political factions.

On 17 May, the Defence Ministry announced the formal unification of all military units under its command — a major step in consolidating Syria’s post-conflict military structure."

Speaking after a meeting with María Angela Holguin Cuellar, the UN secretary-general’s personal envoy for Cyprus, on Monday, Tatar voiced strong criticism of the detentions and said he had urged the UN to relay his concerns directly to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

Tatar also said he had informed Greek Cypriot leader Nikos Christodoulides that the arrests were damaging the already fragile peace process.

""The Greek Cypriot side is trying to suffocate us with embargoes and isolation. These arrests are part of a calculated campaign to bring us to our knees,"" he said, adding, ""We conveyed to the UN that unless this issue is resolved, the trilateral talks will yield no progress.""

Cuéllar, speaking briefly after the meeting, said she took note of Tatar’s concerns and emphasised the importance of building on the confidence-building measures agreed during the Geneva talks in March.

At the heart of Wilders’ proposals is a demand to deploy the army to guard land borders and to turn away every asylum-seeker who attempts to enter the country.

Other measures include a temporary halt to family reunification for recognised refugees, a “one strike you’re out” deportation policy for migrants convicted of violent or sexual crimes, and the expedited return of Syrians on temporary visas—on the grounds that “much of Syria is now safe,” Wilders said on Monday.

Drawing comparisons to policies already adopted by Germany’s new interior minister, Wilders said some European neighbors have “taken the gloves off” on migration and urged the Dutch coalition to follow suit.

“If migration policy is not toughened up, my party is out of the Cabinet,” he threatened, underscoring the high stakes for Prime Minister Mark Rutte’s government.

Coalition tension boils over

Wilders’ ultimatum deepens rifts within the ruling alliance, which also includes the pro-business People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), the centrist New Social Contract, and the agrarian Farmers Citizens Movement.

Since agreeing last October to reintroduce border checks and curb family-member visas, the coalition has implemented only incremental steps—hardly enough for Wilders, who decried the slow pace as “not enough to turn the tide.”

To advance his plan, ministers would need to renegotiate the coalition’s founding agreement before sending legislation to parliament. But with deep disagreements already evident over budget allocations and climate policy, analysts say bridging the gap on migration could prove even more daunting—and potentially fatal for the government’s unity."

Even a recent US Senate bill targeting the Caribbean nation’s criminal networks seems to have brought little global attention to the escalating gang violence, which has caused hunger, mass displacement, and a breakdown of governance in the country of nearly 12 million people.

The apparent indifference towards the plight of Haitians is in stark contrast to a worldwide surge in Haiti-related Google searches in 2021 when the assassination of President Jovenel Moise plunged the country into a power vacuum.

Diego Da Rin, a Haiti analyst at the International Crisis Group, tells TRT World that gangs are “close to securing full control” of Port-au-Prince, the capital city and home to one-third of the country’s population.

“They control all major roads into and out of the capital and have long dominated areas surrounding key ports, where they impose increasingly steep extortion rackets on goods and fuel shipments,” he says.

After the killing of President Moïse in July 2021, Prime Minister Ariel Henry assumed control of Haiti amid widespread protests and without any parliamentary approval. His inability to hold elections or address rising gang violence led to his resignation in April 2024, following coordinated gang attacks that paralysed the capital.

One in every two Haitians faces acute hunger. Over 60 percent of medical facilities in the capital have shut down due to gang violence. The capital’s airport has been closed after the gangs fired at commercial planes last November.

Gangs have also expanded beyond the capital, recently taking over the towns of Mirebalais and Saut d’Eau, says Rin. In response, residents occupied the country’s main hydroelectric plant located near these towns to demand government action, plunging Port-au-Prince into a blackout that has now lasted over a week.

There are reports that many young men joined the gangs because “high unemployment and lack of opportunities” left them with no other choice.

A country in disarray

The transitional presidential council, formed in April 2024, struggles with internal disputes and logistical challenges.

In May 2024, it appointed Garry Conille as prime minister and replaced him with Alix Didier Fils-Aime six months later. His mandate to organise elections by February 2026 faces steep hurdles due to insecurity and a dysfunctional electoral system.

Both the prime minister and the presidential council have shown commitment to holding general elections, which are supposed to be preceded by a constitutional referendum initially planned for February and then pushed to early May.

But the security situation has continued to deteriorate, making it dangerous for people to vote.

“This could directly influence the results of presidential, legislative, and local elections… it remains unlikely that the authorities will be able to meet the February 2026 deadline for transferring power to a newly elected government,” says Rin.

Links between gangs and members of the police and individuals from the elites have further undermined efforts to contain their growing power, Da Rin says, adding that elections should not take place until at least a minimum level of security is restored.

Meanwhile, all international efforts to stabilise Haiti have faltered.

Led by Kenya and authorised by the UN Security Council, the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission began in 2024, but remains understaffed and underfunded.

Haiti’s request to transform the MSS into a UN peacekeeping operation – supported by the US but opposed by Russia and China – aims to secure stable funding, but faces logistical and political barriers.

“Nearly a year after deployment (of the Kenyan-led security mission) started, only 40 percent of the expected personnel are on the ground,” Da Rin says.

The government is now turning to private security companies in an effort to prevent gangs from taking full control of the capital and overthrowing the transitional government – something gang leaders have openly declared as their goal.

A medical disaster in the making

The political dysfunction has compounded the humanitarian crisis in Haiti. Nearly half of Haiti’s population — 5.5 million — requires urgent aid as gang blockades have disrupted food and fuel supplies.

Claire Waterhouse, the head of operations support unit at Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), tells TRT World that six in every 10 health facilities in Port-au-Prince are either closed or non-functional. Those that are still open suffer shortages of staff, equipment and specialised services.

“Our structures are operating at capacity. Every day, our doctors, nurses and drivers take major risks to get to work. Some are trapped in their homes, others caught up in the fighting. Our structures themselves are exposed,” says the representative of MSF, which runs one of the only two trauma centres still operating in the capital.

“Stray bullets regularly fall within the confines of our medical facilities, just metres from our patients and teams,” she says, adding that the situation could turn into a humanitarian catastrophe without rapid intervention from the outside world.

Is foreign intervention needed?

Haitian gangs use guns that are trafficked largely from the US and across the land border with the neighbouring Dominican Republic.

Making ‘desperate’ calls for international intervention, Haitian Defence Minister Jean-Michel Moise recently said the country was on the brink of being “fully controlled” by criminal gangs.

He called for the easing of restrictions on selling arms to the Haitian government in view of the gangs’ easy access to smuggled weapons.

Wolf Pamphile, founder and executive director of the think tank Haiti Policy House, tells TRT World that foreign intervention missions restore a “manipulated equilibrium” while leaving the country perpetually unstable.

“Focusing solely on dismantling existing gangs is short-sighted. Unless the incentives for corrupt actors to employ gangs are removed, new ones will inevitably emerge,” he says.

Direct interventions involving troop deployments in the past might have provided a “deceptive sense of security” but insecurity returned soon after their withdrawal, he adds.

“Elite networks within Haiti play as big of a role in destabilising the country as international actors. They often have shared interest,” he says, adding that restoring peace requires holding everyone from gang members to politicians and business elites accountable for their crimes."

Hussam al Tahan, the internal security chief for the region, said the cells were rounded up on Sunday and that weapons, explosives, and suicide vests were seized thanks to “accurate intelligence.”

Al Tahan on Monday identified the suspects as active in Western Ghouta neighborhoods including Al Kiswah, Deir Khabyah, Al Maqiliba, and Zakiyah.

He warned that the group had been “planning to use these weapons and explosives to destabilise the region,” underscoring the ongoing threat posed by remnant Daesh networks even after the fall of the former regime.

The ruling alliance received 4.55 million votes out of 5.5 million cast, marking a sweeping victory amid the opposition’s absence, Amoroso noted.

Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado had urged supporters to boycott the polls, citing doubts over transparency.

Over 21 million registered voters participated in choosing 24 governors, 285 parliament members, and 260 regional council members for the 2026–2031 legislative term.

The meeting on Sunday focused on enhancing bilateral relations and addressing key regional and global developments, according to Türkiye’s Communications Directorate.

President Erdogan emphasised the importance of working toward the two countries’ shared goal of expanding trade volume to $5 billion.

""We will continue taking steps to reach our trade target and deepen collaboration in energy, transportation, and defence,"" Erdogan told Sharif during the talks, cited by the directorate.

Closer cooperation on counterterrorism and connectivity

The Turkish president underscored the value of increased cooperation in counterterrorism efforts, including intelligence sharing, training, and technological support. He noted that such solidarity serves the interests of both nations.

Highlighting regional connectivity, Erdogan stressed the importance of making the Istanbul–Tehran–Islamabad railway line more efficient and operational, pointing to its potential for boosting regional trade and integration.

In the education sector, the Turkish leader called for concrete steps that could further enrich bilateral ties and promote long-term people-to-people exchange.

Shared stance on Palestine, regional Stability

President Erdogan also expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s principled position on the Palestine issue.

He briefed Prime Minister Sharif on Türkiye’s ongoing efforts to ensure that urgent humanitarian aid reaches Gaza, amid continued conflict in the region.

The high-level meeting was attended by senior Turkish officials, including Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, National Intelligence Organization (MİT) Director İbrahim Kalin, Head of Communications Fahrettin Altun, Chief Foreign Policy and Security Advisor Akif Cagatay Kilic, and Turkish Land Forces Commander Selcuk Bayraktaroğlu.

The dramatic announcement was made on Sunday by the Ugandan army, marking a sharp escalation in tensions between the East African nation and its European partners.

""The Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) has, with immediate effect, suspended all ongoing defence and military cooperation activities with the Federal Republic of Germany,"" army spokesperson Chris Magezi announced on X (formerly Twitter).

The move, Magezi said, is in response to “credible intelligence reports” implicating German Ambassador Mathias Schauer in “subversive activities” within Uganda. While the statement did not specify what those activities entail, it accused the ambassador of cooperating with “hostile pseudo-political-military forces” opposed to the government.

Diplomatic rift amid rising political repression

The suspension follows another government statement on Friday, which warned that some European embassies were supporting “negative and traitorous groups.” That message also pointed directly at Ambassador Schauer.

The German embassy has not commented publicly, and there is no independent verification of the UPDF’s allegations. Schauer, who has served as Germany’s top envoy to Uganda since 2020, reportedly came under scrutiny after a private meeting with President Yoweri Museveni’s brother, during which he allegedly criticised the outspoken and controversial online behavior of Museveni’s son and military chief, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba.

Kainerugaba has drawn international condemnation for his increasingly erratic social media posts, including recent threats against opposition figures.

Longstanding partnership in jeopardy

It remains unclear how the suspension will affect Uganda’s broader military relations with Germany, which has long provided logistical and technical support to the Ugandan army. Bilateral trade between the countries was valued at over $335 million in 2023, with Germany exporting machinery and chemical products to Uganda.

Until now, the German embassy had described relations as built on “stability and trust.”"

Welcoming President al Sharaa and his delegation to the presidential complex on Sunday, Yilmaz described their discussions as “comprehensive consultations on deepening our economic cooperation in the new period.”

According to Yilmaz’s statement on X, both sides evaluated concrete steps toward financial and economic reforms aimed at boosting prosperity across war-scarred Syria.

The Syrian delegation included Foreign Minister Asaad al Shaibani and Defence Minister Murhaf Abu Qasra, alongside Türkiye’s Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek, Defence Industries chief Haluk Gorgun, and Central Bank Governor Fatih Karahan. Their participation underscored the meeting’s dual focus on macroeconomic policy and reconstruction logistics.

Charting a post-sanctions recovery

“With the lifting of sanctions, we anticipate the activation of long-dormant potential, a rise in public and private investments, and strong economic growth,” Yilmaz said, casting the rapprochement as a historic pivot for Syria.

He characterised the country’s emerging reforms as both a “historic transformation and political revolution,” forecasting development breakthroughs that could benefit Syrians and their neighbours alike.

“A revitalised Syria will not only strengthen our bilateral relations but also contribute to broader regional prosperity and stability,” he added, emphasising Türkiye’s commitment to supporting Syria’s peace, development, and reconstruction efforts.

Last week, Trump announced at an investment forum in Saudi Arabia that he would lift the “brutal and crippling” sanctions on Syria at the request of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

From isolation to integration

Sunday’s meeting follows international moves to ease sanctions on Damascus, reflecting a growing consensus that economic engagement is key to lasting stability.

US-Syria relations have steadily improved since former president Bashar al Assad was overthrown in December, ending more than a decade of diplomatic freeze.

Tice was working as a freelance journalist for Agence France-Presse, The Washington Post, and other outlets when he was detained at a checkpoint in August 2012.

Kamalmaz, a Syrian-American psychotherapist, was believed to have died after being detained under the Assad regime in 2017.

Mueller was an aid worker kidnapped by Daesh, which announced her death in February 2015, saying she was killed in a Jordanian air strike, a claim disputed by US authorities.

The announcement came a day after the United States formally lifted sanctions on Syria, marking the start of a new chapter in the previously fraught ties between the two countries.

The visit will focus on key aspects of Turkish-Russian relations, with Fidan expected to conduct a comprehensive review of bilateral cooperation in areas such as trade, energy, and tourism.

Discussions will also explore potential steps to deepen ties between the two countries.

In addition to his meetings with Lavrov and Putin, Fidan is scheduled to hold talks with other senior Russian officials.

The move was confirmed in a statement by the Treasury Department on Friday, which issued a general licence authorising transactions previously banned under the Syrian Sanctions Regulations. The measure effectively dismantles core restrictions that had been in place for over a decade.

The measures from the State and Treasury departments waived for six months a tough set of sanctions imposed by Congress in 2019 and expanded US rules for what foreign businesses can do in Syria.

""Syria must also continue to work towards becoming a stable country that is at peace, and today's actions will hopefully put the country on a path to a bright, prosperous, and stable future,"" he added.

Efforts from Türkiye and Saudi Arabia

The sanctions relief was issued in coordination with a waiver from the US State Department under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.

This authorisation is intended to facilitate participation from international partners and regional allies in Syria's reconstruction, particularly in its financial and energy sectors.

The Treasury noted that the general licence would permit new investment, the provision of financial services, and transactions involving Syrian petroleum products.

It also allows dealings with Syria's new government and certain previously blocked entities.

During a recent tour of the Middle East, President Donald Trump surprised many by declaring his intention to remove what he called the ""brutal and crippling"" sanctions on Syria.

The decision came after pressure from regional allies including Türkiye and Saudi Arabia.

The Trump administration said Friday’s announcements were ""just one part of a broader US government effort to remove the full architecture of sanctions.""

Those were imposed on Syria's former Baath regime rulers over the decades because of their support for Iran-backed militias, a chemical weapons programme and ""abuses"" of civilians.

Their recent stop is Poland, a staunch NATO and EU state, which neighbours Ukraine.","The spectacular rise of the far-right in Poland’s presidential elections last week is a result of voters’ antipathy towards the established political order and a growing ‘Ukraine fatigue’, marking a significant ideological shift for a country known for its antagonism towards Russia.

The far-right surge in Poland comes amid similar trends across the world, with nationalist and populist leaders now in power from the US to India and beyond.

Rafal Trzaskowski, the eastern European country’s pro-EU and centrist candidate, came first with nearly a third of the total vote, while conservative historian Karol Nawrocki followed with barely two points less.

Slawomir Mentzen and Grzegorz Braun, two far-right candidates, came third and fourth, respectively, and won more than twenty percent of the popular vote.

“Such scores for far-right candidates hint at a growing dissatisfaction with the current ruling coalition of centrist and leftist parties, as well as with the former ruling conservative party, PiS,” says Denys Kolesnyk, a French consultant and eastern Europe specialist and the president of MENA Research Center, a Vienna-based think-tank.

Centrist Prime Minister Donald Tusk, the former president of the powerful European Council, leads Poland’s fragile coalition but faces increasing attacks from far-right groups.

Tusk is also facing increasing criticism from the conservative and Eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party, part of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), a rightwing EU platform with many nationalist parties.

Poland will, however, have to wait till early June when Trzaskowski, a moderate conservative, and PiS candidate Nawrocki face off in a tough run-off to decide the next president.

Experts say that the conservative candidate is better placed, with the leftists losing all influence on the election outcome.

“Karol Nawrocki has a good chance of winning the presidential race because he would most likely benefit from some far-right votes, even though neither he nor his party is far-right,” Kolesnyk tells TRT World.

Fed up with the establishment

Experts point out that the far-right's ascendancy in Europe has a similar political trajectory to other populist movements, like Trump’s MAGA campaign, and has been triggered by a similar dissatisfaction with mainstream parties aligned with older political establishments.

“The first-round presidential tally is unprecedented: Slawomir Mentzen and Grzegorz Braun together pulled just over one-fifth of all ballots, the highest for the far-right share since 1989,” says Linas Kojala of the Geopolitics and Security Studies Center in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, a Baltic state which formed a commonwealth with Poland between the 16th and 18th centuries.

Mentzen is an anti-establishment candidate who identified the EU as a “totalitarian” state and once advocated a possible exit from the union. Braun, a firebrand with both xenophobic and anti-Semitic views, left Mentzen’s far-right party after accusing it of not being adequately nationalist.

“Their electorate is disproportionately young, male and urban, mobilised more through social-media channels than through party structures that have long alternated power between [Tusk’s centrist] Civic Platform and Law & Justice,” Kojala tells TRT World.

But Kojala also views the first round result as more of a protest vote against the country’s two-party monopoly by young Poles who felt left behind, rather than “sudden embrace of extremism”.

Kolesnyk, though, adds that the real impact of the far-right on political life in Poland would remain “marginal”, which is a far cry from the “reality in numerous western European states”.

But west Europe’s trend might be becoming a “reality” in the east too, if recent political shifts are anything to go by.

While far-right groups have made big gains in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal, among other west European nations, they have also shown their strength across the east in recent years.

Last week in Romania, far-right leader George Simion lost the country’s presidential runoff but gained more than 46 percent of the total vote in an unprecedented election result.

Nawrocki’s PiS gave open support to Simion, who publicly argued against military aid to Ukraine. Both leaders also embraced during a recent rally in Poland ahead of the elections.

Hungary and Slovakia, the two EU states, have already had nationalist governments.

Why is Polish far-right on the rise?

According to Kolesnyk and Kojala, there are several factors behind the rise of the Polish far-right – from the failure of mainstream parties to an expanding trend of Euroscepticism across the EU, high inflation and finally “Ukraine fatigue”, a term used to denote diminishing public support for continuing military aid to Kiev and growing opposition to the presence of Ukrainian refugees in Poland.

“Dissatisfaction with Donald Tusk's government, as well as grievances accumulated during the rule of the PiS party, have contributed to a situation where voters sought ‘alternative’ conservative candidates,” says Kolesnyk.

“Moreover, there is a general trend of Euroscepticism in the EU that is also visible in Poland, albeit to a lesser extent than in western Europe.”

Kojala sees dissatisfaction with mainstream politics through the lens of a “generational distance”, saying that “voters without memories of communism regard the two established blocs as guardians of an ageing consensus”.

The presence of Ukrainian refugees “may have also sparked a leaning towards far-right ideologies among certain segments of the Polish population,” according to Kolesnyk.

Poland has hosted more than 2.5 million Ukrainian refugees since the beginning of the Ukraine war in early 2022.

Citing a recent survey which found national support for military aid to Kiev had slipped below 50 percent, Kojala says that Ukraine fatigue “creeping in”.

Far-right influencers with large social media followings have successfully managed to portray the EU’s migration policies and climate rules as “external impositions on Polish sovereignty”, potentially affecting voting patterns in the elections.

In fact, fears of the EU’s federalist and integration policies overwhelming member-states’ sovereign rules have been a common theme in many European states – from France to Germany and, most recently, Romania.

In addition to these political factors, various economic difficulties have also increased far-right groups’ appeal to the Polish population, according to Kojala.

“The post-pandemic cost-of-living squeeze still bites: annual inflation was 4.9 percent in March and household rents continue to rise faster than wages.”

Poland has had a complicated history with Moscow, more than many eastern European states, from the time of Imperial Russia to the erstwhile Soviet Union.

“Poland has had quite difficult relations characterised by wars with Muscovy and even occupation by imperial Russia, as well as de facto control by the USSR during the Cold War,” says Kolesnyk.

“It is extremely difficult to spark any pro-Russian sentiment (among Poles), as has been the case, for instance, in France,” he adds.

Interestingly, some Polish far-right activists show pro-Moscow “leanings through anti-Ukrainian and anti-EU rhetoric and actions that align with Russian narratives,” he adds.

But Kojala believes that emerging far-right party leaderships in Poland are not pro-Russian.

“The Polish far right is nationalist and Eurosceptic, but it is not pro-Russian—a crucial distinction in a country where security policy remains firmly Atlanticist,” he says.

PiS’s presidential nationalist candidate Nawrocki backs military aid to Kiev and labels Russia the chief threat to regional security, says Kojala. “Any hint of Russian funding is toxic in Polish politics.”

Even far-right Mentzen’s Confederation leadership publicly condemned the 2022 invasion, he adds."

In today's world, no military of a civilised nation engages in politics,” a cabinet member and special adviser to Bangladesh’s Yunus has said on Friday.

The comments come on the heels of Bangladesh Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman reportedly saying on Wednesday that elections in Bangladesh should be held by December.

""By saying that the election has to be held by December, the military chief failed to maintain his jurisdictional correctness,"" Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, a special assistant to Muhammad Yunus, said in a post on Facebook.

""However, the military must be shown due respect and kept in confidence. Sudden or reckless actions regarding the military must not be taken,” he added.

He also said that Muhammad Yunus is ""not going to step down… he needs to remain"" in office as interim leader to ensure a peaceful transition of power.

The army chief’s statement holds a lot of significance in a country that has suffered from multiple military coups.

Bangladesh's political crisis has escalated this week, with rival parties protesting in the streets of the capital, Dhaka, with a string of competing demands.

Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who took over the interim government after a mass uprising last year, had reportedly threatened to quit if parties did not give him their backing.

Nahid Islam, leader of the National Citizen Party—made up of many of the students who spearheaded the uprising against Hasina—met with Yunus on Thursday evening, another top NCP leader, Ariful Islam Adeeb, said.

""They spoke about the current political situation,"" Adeeb said.

""The chief adviser said he is reconsidering whether he can continue his duties under the current circumstances.""

But Nahid Islam—who had initially been part of Yunus's cabinet before resigning to form a political party—""urged him to remain in office,"" Adeeb said.

Shafiqur Rahman, the chief of Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest religious party, has urged Yunus to call an all-party meeting to address the crisis, a party official said.

‘A peaceful democratic transition’

The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since the student-led revolt that toppled then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, with parties protesting on the streets over a string of demands.

""For the sake of Bangladesh and a peaceful democratic transition, Professor Yunus needs to remain in office,"" Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb said in his post.

""He does not hanker after power.""

Thousands of supporters of the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) rallied in Dhaka on Wednesday, holding large-scale protests against the interim government for the first time.

Yunus has promised that polls will be held by June 2026 at the latest, but supporters of the BNP—seen as the frontrunners in the highly anticipated elections, which will be the first since Hasina was overthrown—demanded he fix a date.

""If the government fails to meet public expectations, it will be difficult for the BNP to continue extending its support,"" senior BNP leader Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain told reporters on Thursday.

""The highest priority should be placed on announcing a clear roadmap for the election.""

The BNP also demanded that Yunus sack two members of his cabinet, accusing them of being close to the NCP, as well as the national security advisor.

""Their presence in the council of advisers raises questions about the nonpartisan and impartial nature of the government,"" Hossain said.

""It seems the government is pushing forward the agenda of a particular group.""

Later in the day, Taiyeb in a social media post said that the statement he had written earlier was his 'personal opinion'."""

Speaking at a party rally in the capital Caracas on Thursday, Maduro, who was sworn in for a third term in January, urged Venezuelans to head to the polls and cast their votes.

He said security forces had successfully prevented attempts to incite violence and plant explosives as part of a broader sabotage effort.

Maduro said the arrests were made under a well-executed plan to preserve national peace and commended his country's army for their role in the operations.

He labelled those detained as ""mercenaries"" and said the judiciary would take necessary legal steps against them.​​​​​​​

US officials from President Donald Trump insist Iran cannot continue to enrich uranium at all in any deal that could see sanctions lifted on Tehran's struggling economy. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi early Friday insisted online that no enrichment would mean “we do NOT have a deal”.

“Figuring out the path to a deal is not rocket science,” Araghchi wrote on the social platform X. “Time to decide.”

The US will be again be represented in the talks by Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff and Michael Anton, the State Department’s policy planning director.

While authorities haven’t offered a location for the talks, another round in Italy’s capital took place at the Omani Embassy there.

Oman's Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi is mediating the negotiations as the Arabian Peninsula nation has been a trusted interlocutor by both Tehran and Washington in the talks.

Enrichment remains key in negotiations. The talks seek to limit Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the US has imposed on the country, closing in on half a century of enmity.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash air strikes targeting Iran’s programme if a deal isn’t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.

Enrichment remains the key point of contention. Witkoff at one point suggested Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67 percent, then later began saying all Iranian enrichment must stop. That position on the American side has hardened over time.

Asked about the negotiations, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said “we believe that we are going to succeed” in the talks and on Washington’s push for no enrichment.

“The Iranians are at that table, so they also understand what our position is, and they continue to go,” Bruce said Thursday.

One idea floated so far that might allow Iran to stop enrichment in the country but maintain a supply of uranium through a consortium in the Mideast backed by regional countries and the US.

However, Iran’s Foreign Ministry has maintained enrichment must continue within the country’s borders and a similar fuel-swap proposal failed to gain traction in negotiations in 2010.

Meanwhile, Israel has threatened to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities on their own if it feels threatened, further complicating tensions in the Mideast already spiked by Israel’s war in Gaza.

Araghchi warned Thursday that Iran would take “special measures” to defend its nuclear facilities if Israel continues to threaten them, while also warning the US it would view it as being complicit in any Israeli attack."

Assessing the recent developments in the goal of a ""terror-free Türkiye,"" the council underlined its determination to closely monitor every stage of the dissolution process, said the council in a statement on Thursday.

From renewed focus on domestic security to growing ambitions as a peace broker across continents, the session marked a critical juncture in Ankara’s evolving role on the world stage.

At the heart of Thursday’s session were updates on Türkiye’s long-running fight against what it calls existential threats to its national unity: the PKK terrorist organisation, its Syrian affiliates PYD/YPG, the Fetullah Terrorist Organisation (FETO) network behind the 2016 coup attempt, and Daesh.

Turkish forces, the council was told, have continued to strike deep into northern Syria and Iraq, targeting PYD/YPG positions in Afrin and Kobani, while tightening intelligence coordination with Baghdad.

Meanwhile, prosecutions against suspected FETO members remain active in Turkish courts.

The council members praised the “determination, perseverance, and success” of the country’s security forces and pledged close oversight of ongoing operations.

The message was clear: while major offensives may have subsided, vigilance remains non-negotiable.

A war-torn neighbour, a fragile opportunity

The meeting also discussed the developments in Syria.

The council reiterated Ankara’s support for the Syrian government’s efforts to restore national control, expressing cautious optimism about international calls to lift economic sanctions.

Ankara emphasised its commitment to Syria’s sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity, while warning against any efforts to fracture the country.

The council called for a principled international stance and stressed that purging the region of terrorist groups would not only benefit Türkiye but also open the door to a new era of peace in Iraq, Syria, and Iran.

Gaza, mediation, and a role beyond borders

The council also issued a strong condemnation of Israel’s ongoing military actions in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen.

It accused the Israeli government of pursuing expansionist goals that derail regional peace, and urged the global community to take responsibility in curbing such threats.

Türkiye, the council said, intends to expand its presence as a stabilising force in conflict zones far beyond its borders. In Africa, Ankara is deepening its support for security efforts in unstable regions such as Sudan, Libya, and the Horn of Africa.

More broadly, the council pointed to Türkiye’s growing reputation as a diplomatic hub.

From facilitating the latest Russia-Ukraine ceasefire talks in Istanbul, to hosting quiet backchannel discussions between NATO and non-aligned states in Antalya, Türkiye is carving out a space as both mediator and power broker, it added.

Ankara even played a behind-the-scenes role in easing recent tensions between India and Pakistan.

One of the few regions showing concrete progress is the South Caucasus.

The council welcomed the recent breakthrough between Azerbaijan and Armenia, who reached an agreement on a draft peace deal.

Türkiye, a longtime ally of Baku, reaffirmed its hope that a lasting peace—one that benefits the wider region—can soon be realised."

The move signals Ankara’s growing role in Syria’s post-conflict reconstruction after more than a decade of civil war.

Speaking at a joint press conference with Syrian Energy Minister Mohammed al Bashir on Thursday, Bayraktar said the gas exports would support the generation of an additional 1,300 megawatts of electricity in Syria, helping to meet the country’s chronic energy shortfalls.

In addition, Türkiye will provide a further 1,000 megawatts of electricity directly to Syria to meet its short-term needs, Bayraktar added.

Pipeline reactivation, future projects

Al Bashir confirmed that both sides had agreed to reactivate a long-dormant gas pipeline connecting Syria and Türkiye, with flows expected to begin in June.

“This will significantly boost electricity generation, which will positively impact the Syrian people’s electricity needs,” he said.

The two ministers also discussed completing a 400-kilovolt power line linking the two countries, expected to be operational by the end of the year. The line will enable Syria to import up to 500 megawatts of electricity from Türkiye.

Beyond electricity, the agreement paves the way for Turkish private sector investment in Syria’s energy and mining sectors.

Bayraktar noted that Turkish firms will be invited to explore opportunities in mining, phosphate extraction, power generation, and electricity distribution.

“There is very intensive work underway regarding the discovery of new natural resources, whether gas or oil, on land or at sea,” Bayraktar said, hinting at potential joint exploration in the future."

Speaking before media professionals from diverse regions during the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) News Group Meeting and Global News Forum in Istanbul on Thursday, Altun emphasised the urgent need to confront challenges facing journalism today—from digital disruption to global disinformation—and to restore fairness and accuracy in media narratives.

‘Truth-centred journalism must prevail’

Altun stated that the foremost challenge in today’s global media ecosystem is ensuring journalism remains rooted in truth. He underlined the need for collaboration and inclusive representation of global societies, free from stereotypes and marginalisation.

“Only media professionals committed to discovering the truth—free of prejudice and fear—can meet this challenge,” he said. Altun added that the ABU, which reaches more than four billion people globally, is one of the key institutions capable of addressing this urgent need.

He criticised the dominance of Western-centric information flows that have shaped global narratives since the 19th century, arguing they have contributed to conflict and division rather than coexistence. Altun also warned of a new era of media injustice, now empowered by technologies such as artificial intelligence.

One such threat, he said, is the “algorithm dictatorship” imposed by Western social media companies, which he accused of producing manipulated, biased content tailored to specific audiences—thus reinforcing oppression and dominance under the guise of connectivity.

‘Israel's atrocities are an AI-supported genocide’

Turning to Gaza, Altun condemned Israel's military offensive, describing it as “a genocide backed by full military and technological power.” He said Israel’s crimes must be called out unequivocally, regardless of the cost.

“There is a horrifying reality in Palestine that words struggle to express,” he said. “What the Israeli government is doing to innocent civilians on Palestinian land is boundless slaughter and must be shouted from the rooftops.”

Altun recalled the recent firing of a software engineer by a major global tech company for speaking out in support of Palestine. That engineer, he said, exposed how Israel exploits AI technologies in its attacks and labelled the offensive “the world’s first AI-supported genocide.”

Highlighting Israel’s recent attack on a group of diplomats—including a Turkish consulate official—in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, Altun said the incident once again revealed Israel’s “systematic lawlessness and brutality.”

He paid tribute to journalists who have risked and lost their lives to report from Gaza.

Among them, he mentioned TRT Arabi reporter Rubai Khalid, who received news of her family’s home being bombed live on air; TRT cameraman Sami Shahada, who pledged to continue working despite losing a leg; and Anadolu Agency’s Said Abu Nebhan, killed by Israeli fire on January 10.

“Since October 7, 2023, Israel has killed 222 journalists—more than the number of journalists killed in all wars in the past century,” he said.

“These brave journalists never stopped reporting the truth, even under fire. As President Erdogan has said, they opened a communications corridor from Gaza to the world.”

He offered his heartfelt thanks to Türkiye’s public broadcasters, particularly TRT and Anadolu Agency, for their “devoted efforts to keep that corridor alive.”"

General Waker-Uz-Zaman was reported to have told officers on Wednesday that elections should be held by December this year - if not earlier, according to Bangladeshi newspapers on Thursday.

The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since the student-led revolt that ousted then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina in August, with parties protesting on the streets making rafts of demands.

""Bangladesh is passing through a chaotic phase,"" Waker-Uz-Zaman said, according to the newspapers.

""The situation is worsening by the day. The structure of the civil administration and law enforcement agencies has collapsed and failed to reconstitute.""

No date has been set for elections but interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has promised polls will be held by June 2026 at the latest.

But the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), seen as the front-runners in the elections, have repeatedly demanded an election date.

The BNP on Wednesday held protests in the capital Dhaka, significant in that they for the first time demonstrated against the caretaker government.

In response to a question from an officer, the army chief reportedly said: ""Elections should be held by December, if not earlier.""

He also is reported to have told officers to ""carry out your duties with honesty and impartiality during the election"".

It was Waker-Uz-Zaman who announced in August last year that Hasina had been overthrown, with the military taking brief control.

Days later, Waker-Uz-Zaman handed over power to Yunus, 84, who has said he will lead the caretaker government until the next elections.

Lieutenant Colonel Sami-Ud-Dowla Chowdhury, the military spokesperson, confirmed that Waker-Uz-Zaman had addressed officers on Wednesday but said the ""meeting was confidential"".

But three sources with direct knowledge of the meeting told AFP that the army chief emphasised the urgency of holding elections and said they should be held by December.

Reaffirming its consistent position against terrorism, the ministry emphasised the need for regional cooperation in combating extremism.

“Türkiye reiterates its principled stance against all forms and manifestations of terrorism and emphasizes the importance of cooperation in counter-terrorism efforts in South Asia,” the ministry added.

At least five people, including three children, were killed and several injured in the explosion that targeted a school bus in southwestern Balochistan province, according to the Pakistan army.

The army said the attack was ""planned and orchestrated by India and executed by its proxies"" in Balochistan, and targeted innocent school children in Khuzdar.

""These Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool ... to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians,"" it added.​​​​​​​ New Delhi, however, rejected the claims by Pakistan.

The declaration came on Wednesday at the close of an informal summit of OTS heads of state held in Hungary’s capital, Budapest.

According to Turkish Foreign Ministry sources, the statement reflects growing political will within the bloc to bolster institutional strength, deepen regional ties, and coordinate on global issues.

The summit, held under the theme “Meeting Point of East and West,” was attended by leaders and officials from member states Türkiye, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan, as well as observer states Hungary, Turkmenistan, and the TRNC.

Strong support for Turkish Cypriots

A central highlight of the declaration was the OTS’s explicit support for the TRNC, which it praised for its contributions to the organisation. It also called for a “mutually acceptable and implementable” solution to the decades-long Cyprus dispute, one that is grounded in the current realities on the island and ensures equal rights for Turkish Cypriots.

The move marks a notable shift in multilateral support for the TRNC, which declared independence in 1983 following years of Greek aggression and violence against Turks, and a 1974 military intervention by Türkiye. The declaration also emphasised the importance of solidarity in securing these rights and preventing further marginalisation of Turkish Cypriots.

Commitment to unity, security, and youth cooperation

The declaration reaffirmed the OTS’s commitment to unity, territorial integrity, and institutional development, as outlined in the Charter of the Turkic World.

Leaders highlighted the importance of preventing efforts to divide or weaken the Turkic bloc, and called for increased cooperation among members and observers.

Notably, the document encouraged new youth and sports exchange programs, including events hosted by observers like the TRNC, in a bid to strengthen cultural and societal ties across the Turkic world.

Türkiye’s regional role, global concerns

The leaders expressed appreciation for Türkiye’s constructive role in fostering regional peace, particularly its efforts in Syria toward a stable political transition, lifting sanctions, and preserving territorial integrity.

The declaration also addressed international crises, including the ongoing war in Gaza. OTS leaders voiced “deep concern” over the humanitarian situation and reiterated calls for a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire, the release of hostages, and the implementation of a two-state solution based on 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital.

New initiatives on Afghanistan and terrorism

Another key outcome was the establishment of an Afghanistan Working Group, tasked with developing a unified position among member states on issues related to Afghanistan. A separate joint statement was adopted by the Council of Heads of State on this topic.

The summit also called for joint action to combat terrorism, transnational crime, and cyber threats, while urging accelerated cooperation in the defence industry. Member states pledged to harmonise efforts on disinformation, racism, Islamophobia, and hate speech.

Backing for Türkiye’s global candidacies

The declaration endorsed Türkiye’s bids for several high-profile international positions, including a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council (2037–2038), a seat on UNESCO’s Executive Board (2025–2029), and membership in the UN Economic and Social Council (2026–2028).

Amit Shah said troops had killed 27 rebels in central India, including the ""topmost leader"" of the Naxalite rebellion, named after the village in the foothills of the Himalayas where the Maoist-inspired movement began nearly six decades ago.

""Today, in an operation in Narayanpur, Chhattisgarh, our security forces have neutralised 27 dreaded Maoists, including Nambala Keshav Rao, alias Basavaraju, the general secretary of CPI-Maoist, topmost leader, and the backbone of the Naxal movement,"" Shah said in a statement.

India says continues its offensive against the last strongholds of the Naxalite rebellion — a far-left, Maoist-inspired insurgency that began in 1967.

Once a major base for multiple Naxalite factions, the Karreguttalu Hills served as a hub for weapons distribution and strategic training.

The Naxalites claim their struggle is aimed at defending the rights of tribal communities in the region.

At their height in the mid-2000s, the group is believed to have commanded up to 20,000 fighters and held sway over nearly a third of the country.

‘Eradicating Naxalism from its roots’

The firefight broke out deep inside a forest in Chhattisgarh's Narayanpur district, a remote and densely wooded region that has long served as a Maoist stronghold.

Sinha said the gun battle took place after intelligence reports indicated the presence of ""top Maoist leaders"" in the area.

But Sinha said it was not clear who exactly had been killed. ""The bodies have not yet been identified,"" Sinha said.

Earlier this month, police said they had killed 31 Maoist rebels during a three-week operation aimed at capturing a strategic hill range previously under the control of the group.

The suspects, reportedly aged 14 to 18, are said to have been members of a “right-wing extremist terrorist organisation” founded in April 2024 and known as the “Last Wave of Defence”, the federal prosecutor’s office said.

Their aim was “to bring about the collapse of the democratic system in the Federal Republic of Germany through acts of violence, primarily against migrants and political opponents”, they said in a statement.

Prosecutors detailed several attacks carried out by the group, including an arson attack on a cultural centre in Altdobern in October 2024. The building was occupied by several people who escaped injury by chance.

Rubio was on Tuesday addressing the Senate Foreign Relations and Appropriations Committees on the proposed State Department budget for fiscal year 2026 when two activists shouted slogans condemning US policy.

Both protestors were removed by security.

There were also protests before Rubio entered the room.

""Stop the genocide,"" ""Sanction Israel,"" and ""Start feeding the children!"" protestors affiliated with CODEPINK, a group advocating peace and human rights, yelled as Rubio was entering the hearing.

Committee chairman Jim Risch had earlier warned of ""zero tolerance"" for disruptions, threatening custody and year-long bans for any protester attempting to engage with lawmakers.

The disruption follows mounting criticism of US military aid to Israel.

The Israeli army has been carrying out genocide against Gaza since October 2023, reportedly killing nearly 64,000 Palestinians, most of them women and children — including some 11,000 people feared buried under debris of bombed homes — rejecting international demands for a ceasefire, and weaponising food aid.

Experts suggest the actual Palestinian death toll may be closer to 200,000.

Washington doles out $3.8 billion in annual military funding to its longtime ally Israel, and the administration has so far resisted calls to condition any arms transfers even though senior US officials have criticised Israel over the high civilian death toll in Gaza.

The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.

Meanwhile, Rubio told the hearing that the United States has not discussed the deportation of Palestinians from Gaza to Libya, but he said that Washington had asked other countries in the region if they would be open to accepting Palestinians who want to move voluntarily.

""What we have talked to some nations about is if someone voluntarily and willingly says I want to go somewhere else for some period of time because I'm sick, because my children need to go to school, or what have you, are there countries in the region willing to accept them for some period of time?,"" Rubio said, adding that he was not aware of Libya being included in that.

""We need to reset the relationship... but more importantly, iron out issues of concerns that may exist, albeit some of them based on disinformation,"" presidential spokesman Vincent Magwenya told 702 radio on Tuesday.

Trump has offered ""refuge"" to white people from the Afrikaner minority, bringing over a first group of around 50 people on May 12.

If this resettlement programme continues, South Africa ""will take exception,"" Magwenya said.

""As a government, we can't prevent people from leaving but we will express our displeasure at people who leave under false pretences and ... under the guise of things that are not happening in our country,"" he said.

""It's going to be difficult for the Trump administration to sustain this so-called 'genocide' in South Africa. And the burden of proof is going to ultimately fall on the US to substantiate these claims,"" he said.

""There's absolutely no way that the Trump administration does not know that what they are propagating is false.""

Ramaphosa and a delegation of government officials arrived in Washington on Monday in a bid to reset strained ties with the US.

Gaza genocide case against Israel

Magwenya questioned if the South Africans who had shown interest in Trump's offer of resettlement even met the criteria of having been persecuted. Some media profiling people in the group have also cast doubt on their stories.

Some right-wing Afrikaner lobby groups have claimed that Afrikaans farmers are being murdered in targeted killings, but authorities say this is unfounded. Most of the victims of South Africa's sky-high murder rate are young Black men in urban areas, according to police figures.

Afrikaners also are protesting at a new education law that they say will undermine education in their Afrikaans mother-tongue.

Ramaphosa will be accompanied at his meeting at the Oval Office on Wednesday by four ministers including John Steenhuisen, who heads the agriculture portfolio and is leader of the pro-business Democratic Alliance, a major party in the government of national unity.

Securing trade ties with the United States was a priority as Ramaphosa is ""duty bound to protect livelihoods, to create the jobs that need to be created,"" Magwenya said.

However, South Africa would not withdraw its case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or undo laws meant to empower black South Africans as part of efforts to redress inequalities inherited from apartheid, he said, referencing two of the sticking points in US-SA relations.

South Africa to offer Musk Starlink deal

South Africa's government plans to offer a workaround of local Black ownership laws for Elon Musk's Starlink internet service to operate in the country, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing three people familiar with the discussions.

The offer would come at a ""last-minute"" meeting planned for Tuesday night between South African officials and Musk or his representatives, Bloomberg said.

Musk, who is South African-born, has previously claimed Starlink was barred from operating in South Africa because he is not Black, an allegation South African officials refuted.

South Africa's telecoms regulator said in March that Starlink had not applied for a licence.

Musk's assertion appeared to be taking a swipe at local Black Economic Empowerment rules, requiring foreign-owned telecommunications licencees to sell 30 percent of the equity in their local subsidiaries to historically disadvantaged groups.

Ramaphosa’s spokesman Vincent Magwenya told Reuters on Monday that the issue of licencing for Starlink would be discussed during the US visit."

The discussions, which spanned several hours on Tuesday, focused heavily on restoring bilateral relations and stabilising Syria after years of civil war.

Kalin emphasised Türkiye’s respect for Syria’s territorial integrity and political sovereignty, affirming Ankara’s readiness to support Damascus in its efforts to restore order and rebuild state institutions, according to the sources.

“Türkiye is committed to Syria’s unity and long-term stability,” Kalin was quoted as saying by Turkish officials familiar with the exchange.

Counter‑terrorism and border security

A central theme of the dialogue was joint security cooperation. The two sides reportedly discussed the disarmament and reintegration of armed groups, particularly the PKK/YPG terrorist organisation, into a new Syrian framework.

Turkish officials reiterated their long-standing concerns over terrorist activity near the border and emphasised the importance of securing both nations’ frontiers. Discussions also addressed the handover of Daesh-linked prisons and detention camps to Syrian authorities, a move Ankara believes is essential for long-term regional security.

The talks extended into broader strategic matters, including border management, reopening of key customs gates, and rebuilding commercial routes. Türkiye expressed its willingness to assist Damascus in reestablishing these critical infrastructure points, which had been severely disrupted by the war.

Regional developments on the agenda

Kalin and the Syrian leadership also covered ongoing regional tensions, including the intensifying Israeli air strikes on Syrian territory and frequent airspace violations.

The lifting of international sanctions on Syria, as well as the continued fight against remnants of the Daesh terrorist organisation, were also high on the agenda.

Another pressing issue was the voluntary and safe return of Syrian refugees.

Turkish officials reportedly conveyed Ankara’s desire to coordinate with Damascus on the logistics and security guarantees necessary to facilitate returns."

After the meeting, Vucic posted on social media that he was pleased to host Fidan and emphasised the importance Serbia places on its relationship with Türkiye for regional stability.

Vucic described bilateral relations as characterised by active political dialogue and wide-ranging cooperation in areas including the economy, energy, tourism, culture and education.

The court's order on Monday, with only one noted dissent, puts on hold a ruling from a federal judge in San Francisco that kept in place Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for the Venezuelans that would have otherwise expired last month.

The status allows people already in the United States to live and work legally because their native countries are deemed unsafe for return due to natural disaster or civil strife.

A federal appeals court had earlier rejected the administration’s request to put the order on hold while the lawsuit continues.

""This is the largest single action stripping any group of non-citizens of immigration status in modern US history,"" said Ahilan Arulanantham, one of the lawyers representing Venezuelan plaintiffs in the case.

It was ""truly shocking"" that the Supreme Court authorised the move without giving the case more consideration, he added.

The case is the latest in a string of emergency appeals President Donald Trump’s administration has made to the Supreme Court, many of them related to immigration.

Last week, the government asked the court to allow it to end humanitarian parole for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, setting them up for potential deportation as well.

The high court also has been involved in legal battles over Trump's efforts to swiftly deport Venezuelans accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act.

The administration has moved aggressively to withdraw various protections that have allowed immigrants to remain in the country, including ending the temporary protected status for a total of 600,000 Venezuelans and 500,000 Haitians.

That status is granted in 18-month increments.

The protections had been set to expire April 7, but US District Judge Edward Chen ordered a pause on those plans. He found that the expiration threatened to severely disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and could cost billions in lost economic activity.

Chen, who was appointed to the bench by Democratic President Barack Obama, found the government hadn't shown any harm caused by keeping the programme alive.

But Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote on behalf of the administration that Chen's order impermissibly interferes with the administration's power over immigration and foreign affairs.

In addition, Sauer told the justices, people affected by ending the protected status might have other legal options to try to remain in the country because the ""decision to terminate TPS is not equivalent to a final removal order.""

Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters or civil strife.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she would have rejected the administration’s emergency appeal."

Following a two-hour-call with US President Donald Trump on Monday, the Russian leader said that Moscow is ready to work on a memorandum for a future peace treaty.

Putin thanked Trump for supporting the resumption of direct talks between Moscow and Kiev, and said that Trump noted Russia's support for peace, though the key question was how to move towards peace.

""We have agreed with the president of the United States that Russia will propose and is ready to work with the Ukrainian side on a memorandum on a possible future peace accord, defining a number of positions, such as, for example, the principles of settlement, the timing of a possible peace agreement,"" Putin told reporters near the Black Sea resort of Sochi.

If appropriate agreements are reached, then there could be a ceasefire, Putin said, adding that direct talks between Russia and Ukraine ""gives reason to believe that we are generally on the right track.""

""I would like to note that, on the whole, Russia's position is clear. The main thing for us is to eliminate the root causes of this crisis,"" Putin said. ""We just need to determine the most effective ways to move towards peace.""

Talks to start 'immediately'

Trump said that Russia and Ukraine would immediately start ceasefire talks after his talk with Putin, but the Kremlin leader fell short of agreeing to the unconditional truce proposed by Washington.

Trump painted a more upbeat picture of the situation after the two-hour call, as he desperately seeks a deal to end a grinding conflict that he had promised on the election trail to solve within 24 hours.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had no details about a ""memorandum"" on a peace roadmap that Putin said he discussed with Trump, but was willing to look at Moscow's proposals.

""Once we have received the memorandum or proposals from the Russians, we will be able to formulate our vision accordingly, as we see it,"" Zelenskyy told reporters in Kiev, adding that he had no further details on the potential document.

Pope offer to host talks

Pope Leo XIV has offered to host Russia-Ukraine peace talks in a gesture welcomed by US and European leaders, Italy's Prime Minister Georgia Meloni said.

“We condemn the delusional statements, which are completely incompatible with historical facts, made by Greek authorities on the pretext of the anniversary of unfounded 'Pontic' allegations,” the Turkish foreign ministry said on Monday in a statement.

The ministry rejected “such imaginary allegations,” which it said aimed to “defame our War of Independence” launched under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic, on May 19, 1919.

Ankara accused Greece of attempting to ""read history in reverse,"" calling the allegations ""null and void.”

The ministry said it is a ""historical reality"" that the Greek army committed ""countless atrocities in Anatolia,"" which it occupied with the support of imperialist powers of the time.

“Greek atrocities in Anatolia, which were referred to in the reports of the Allied Commission of Inquiry, were also put on record in Article 59 of the Lausanne Peace Treaty, with Greece being obliged to pay compensation for its acts that violated the laws of war,” the ministry added.

The statement underlined “The Pontic activities,” which emerged in the late 19th century as an extension of “Greece’s Megali Idea ambitions”, were condemned to “eternal failure through our Nation’s resolute struggle.”

The ministry urged Greek authorities to ""abandon their policy of exploiting for populist goals those historical events which led to the Turkish-Greek population exchange"" and called on them to remember the ""brutal crimes committed against Turks and other ethnic groups, beginning with the Tripolitsa massacre of 1821.""

“Such initiatives that draw hostility from history and aim to harm the relations between our countries, which have been advancing with a positive momentum in recent years, should now be brought to an end,” the ministry said."

Durov was sensationally detained in Paris in 2024 and is under formal investigation by French authorities over illegal content on his popular service.

""The DGSE strongly refutes allegations that requests to ban accounts linked to any electoral process were made on these occasions,"" the Directorate General for External Security (DSGE) service said in a statement.

The Russian-born co-founder of Telegram alleged in a post on X on Sunday night that DGSE chief Nicolas Lerner had asked him this spring ""to ban conservative voices in Romania ahead of elections"".

""I refused. We didn't block protesters in Russia, Belarus, or Iran. We won't start doing it in Europe,"" Durov, 40, said.

The centrist mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan, won a tense rerun of Romania's presidential election on Sunday, beating nationalist George Simion in a vote seen as crucial for the direction of the EU and NATO member bordering war-torn Ukraine.

Intelligence contacted Pavel Durlov

In an earlier post on Sunday, Durov alleged interference by France in the Romanian election.

""A Western European government (guess which) approached Telegram, asking us to silence conservative voices in Romania ahead of today's presidential elections,"" Durov said on his channel.

The post did not name France but used an icon of a French baguette.

France's foreign ministry said it ""categorically rejects these allegations"".

The French intelligence service — made famous by the fictional hit TV series ""The Bureau"" — on Monday confirmed it had been in contact with Durov.

""The DGSE states that it has indeed been obliged, on several occasions in recent years, to contact PD directly to remind him firmly of his company's responsibilities, and his own personal responsibilities, in terms of preventing terrorist and child pornography threats,"" it said.

Durov was detained at Le Bourget airport outside Paris in August 2024 and charged with a litany of violations related to the popular messaging app he founded.

After days of questioning, he was charged with several counts of failing to curb extremist and terrorist content and released on a five-million-euro ($5.6 million) bail.

Durov has since announced steps appearing to bow to Paris's demands.

In March, he was allowed to temporarily leave France and travel to Dubai, sources have told AFP at the time.

The Kremlin on Monday said claims of France's meddling were ""not news.""

""The fact that European countries — France, Great Britain, Germany — are interfering in the internal affairs of other countries is not news,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

""These are just bits and pieces that are being brought to light.”"

He beat George Simion, a far-right and a Trump admirer.

With nearly 54 percent of the vote, Dan defeated his rival George Simion, who had led the first round of voting on May 4.

Simion has raised concerns about the integrity of the vote. Speaking at a press conference, he warned of potential fraud. He alleged that 1.8 million deceased individuals remained on the electoral roll, quipping that he hoped they wouldn’t “rise from the dead and vote.”

On the surface, the election was a contest between two very different futures: one rooted in closer ties with the European Union and NATO, and another fuelled by nationalism, scepticism of Western institutions, and resistance to military support for Ukraine.

But it is not just a battle between two rivals. The campaign was marred by fierce ideological battles and competing allegations of foreign meddling.

The election was clouded by renewed allegations of Russian interference, including a disinformation campaign linked to Telegram. Authorities had already annulled last year’s vote over similar concerns of foreign interference.

The country finds itself back into the spotlight of an intensifying geopolitical debate: Who is interfering in Romania’s democracy — Russia or the West?

Western applause and suspicion

Dan’s victory was quickly celebrated by European leaders. France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Poland’s Donald Tusk, Moldova’s Maia Sandu, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen all offered congratulations.

Von der Leyen posted: “The Romanian people have turned out massively to the polls. They have chosen the promise of an open, prosperous Romania in a strong Europe. Together let’s deliver on that promise.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also welcomed what he called a “historic victory,” calling Romania a “reliable partner” in the region.

But as ballots were still being counted, controversy erupted over potential European interference.

Pavel Durov, the CEO and founder of the encrypted messaging platform Telegram, posted a statement on X, accusing the French intelligence services of attempting to pressure the company into silencing right-wing voices during the Romanian election.

“A Western European government (guess which 🥖) approached Telegram asking us to silence conservative voices in Romania ahead of today’s presidential elections. I flatly refused,” Durov wrote on X. “Telegram will not restrict the freedoms of Romanian users or block their political channels.”

He continued: You can’t ‘defend democracy’ by destroying democracy. You can’t ‘fight election interference’ by interfering with elections. You either have freedom of speech and fair elections — or you don’t. And the Romanian people deserve both.”

Durov later identified the official, a spy chief, directly: “This spring at the Salon des Batailles in the Hotel de Crillon, Nicolas Lerner, head of French intelligence, asked me to ban conservative voices in Romania ahead of elections. I refused,” he wrote on Sunday night. “We didn’t block protesters in Russia, Belarus, or Iran. We won’t start doing it in Europe.”

France’s foreign ministry categorically denied the allegation. In a statement, it said, “France categorically rejects these allegations and calls on everyone to exercise responsibility and respect for Romanian democracy.”

Just as accusations were levelled against France, Romanian officials were also issuing fresh warnings about Russian meddling — a concern that has loomed large since the first round of voting was annulled in December due to evidence of outside influence.

The issue has loomed since the annulled first round of voting in December, which was thrown out following evidence of foreign influence.

Far-right candidate Calin Georgescu, who led that initial vote, was later banned from running after being charged with founding a fascist organisation.

Ahead of the second round, government officials warned that Moscow’s tactics may be resurfacing.

“As Romanians returned to the polls, government officials warned that the same tactics might be resurfacing.

“During Romania’s ongoing presidential elections yet again, we see the hallmarks of Russian interference,” a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry said.

“A viral campaign of fake news on Telegram & other social media platforms is aimed to influence the electoral process. This was expected & authorities debunked the fake news,” the spokesperson added.

Russia has already denied the interference allegations."
5/19/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/d11b7fe03bb6,"Has the Western media finally turned its back on Israel?From the BBC to The Atlantic, several outlets have denounced Israel’s Gaza strategy in a rare collective stand against the US’s backing of Tel Aviv’s genocidal war.","For years, Western media outlets maintained a largely consistent narrative on Israel, prioritising Israel's security concerns and right to self-defence while relegating Palestinian suffering to the margins of their coverage.

Despite reports estimating between 77,000 and 109,000 Palestinian civilian deaths in Israel's military campaign since October 7, those publications only recently began questioning Israel’s immorality during the war and started to pull back their longstanding support for Israeli military actions.

Since last week, publications including the Financial Times and The Economist, ran searing indictments of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's war plan and of Washington's reluctance to intervene.

Thomas Friedman, an opinion columnist of The New York Times, who had long been a supporter of Israel, now warns that “this Israeli government is not our ally” and accuses it of undermining American interests in the region.

In the same week, an editorial by Financial Times condemned “the West’s shameful silence on Gaza” and The Atlantic linked Netanyahu’s promised “absolute victory” to the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.

The Economist declared that the war “must end” and urged President Donald Trump to compel a “ceasefire”.

What explains this sudden surge in pointed commentary, critical of Israel, from major media players? Does it signal a fundamental realignment in the international discourse surrounding Israel?

“Netanyahu is not our friend”

The recent noticeable shift in Western media on Israel does not seem to be random.

There are timely editorials mirroring several elements, including public rifts between the White House and Netanyahu over the Gaza strategy and Iran and mounting evidence that Israel’s offensive has stalled militarily and backfiring politically, with more than 60 percent of Israelis opposing a fresh ground push and reservist call-ups going unanswered.

As civilian deaths soar, editorials have warned that Israel’s ongoing Gaza invasion is turning into “genocide”.

According to polls cited by the BBC, only 46 percent of Americans now express support for Israel — the lowest in 25 years — while Palestinian support has reached an unprecedented 33 per cent.

The recent media realignment also coincides with growing tensions between Netanyahu and the Trump administration, detailed in Shalom Lipner's Foreign Policy article about a potential “collision course” between Netanyahu and Trump.

The piece focuses on how the Israeli prime minister is “fast discovering that his ability to manoeuvre in that political minefield has been curtailed dramatically” in Washington, where Republican support now “operates under the binding spell of Trump”.

This point has been amplified by the US president skipping Israel on his Middle East tour because “there’s nothing he can get from a visit to Israel at the moment.”

Friedman's NYT piece, on the same day, directly addresses President Trump, saying, “this Israeli government is behaving in ways that threaten hardcore US interests in the region. Netanyahu is not our friend”.

It argues that the Netanyahu government's priority is not peace but ""the annexation of the West Bank, the expulsion of the Palestinians of Gaza and the re-establishment there of Israeli settlements"".

However, the shift does not only concern political reasons but also military struggles.

Considering a lone Houthi missile slipped past Israel’s US-made THAAD defences in early May and forced Ben Gurion Airport to close and ground all flights, the Yemeni group’s breach has revealed an unexpected weakness in the American-supplied missile shield. The dangers were compounded by the loss of 3 fighter jets and 7 Reaper drones.

Together, these setbacks are undercutting Washington’s interests in the region and can help explain why newsrooms are rethinking their stand on Israel’s war.

Trying to limit the damage, the United States has since signed off on a “truce between Washington and the relevant authorities in Sanaa” that constrained Houthi attacks on American ships while leaving Israel out in the cold.

Former CNN international correspondent and founder of International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance (INARA) Arwa Damon thinks the current shift in Western media's approach to Israel recalls a familiar pattern of the post-2003 Iraq coverage.

“This is similar to what we saw post 9/11 when the Western media outlets who jumped on the Bush administration's war train began to become more critical of the US-led invasion of Iraq, questioning and criticising the administration whose presented narrative did not match what the media was witnessing firsthand on the ground,” she tells TRT World.

The same pattern, she argues, has played out far more slowly in Gaza because outside reporters are kept out and the only consistent eyewitnesses are local journalists whose work many editors have hesitated to trust.

“In the case of Israel and Gaza, this shift has taken longer. Foreign media is not permitted by Israel for this very reason into Gaza and unfortunately Palestinian journalists who have been doing an incredible job are still viewed through a lens that questions their credibility,” Damon says."

More than 80 people -- including high-ranking military officers, former government ministers and police and intelligence officials -- are to testify in a preliminary trial phase expected to last at least two weeks.

Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison if convicted of plotting to remain in office after rival Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva had narrowly defeated him in October 2022 elections.

Prosecutors say he led a ""criminal organisation"" planning to declare a state of emergency so new elections could be held.

He also stands accused of being aware of a plot to assassinate Lula, his vice president Geraldo Alckmin, and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes -- a Bolsonaro foe and one of the judges hearing the current case.

Bolsonaro has always denied any role in a coup attempt, blaming the charges on ""political persecution.""

Last week he told the Uol site that prosecutors were fabricating a ""telenovela scenario,"" a reference to the melodramatic TV soap operas popular in Latin America.

The former army captain will be tried along with seven former aides accused of key roles in the alleged plot.

They include four former ministers, one former navy commander and the head of intelligence services during Bolsonaro's 2019-2022 presidency.

Several former Brazilian presidents have had legal entanglements since the end of the 1964-1985 military dictatorship, but Bolsonaro is the first to face coup charges.

A 900-page report by the federal police lays out the alleged coup plan in detail, saying it called for a decree ordering a new election -- and for Lula's assassination.

But the attempt failed to draw crucial military support and ultimately collapsed, prosecutors say.

The charges cover the riots of January 8, 2023, when thousands of Bolsonaro supporters invaded and sacked key government buildings, demanding a ""military intervention"" to oust Lula a week after his inauguration.

Bolsonaro was in the United States that day, but is suspected of having been behind the riots, which prosecutors say were the coup plotters' ""last hope.""

Despite his ban on running in elections, Bolsonaro has insisted he plans to be a candidate in next year's vote.

But after recent abdominal surgery -- his latest of many rounds to repair persistent damage from a knife attack in 2018 -- he has also said that a conviction now would be a ""death penalty, political and physical.""

Key figures will be questioned via videoconference during the preliminary trial phase beginning Monday led by de Moraes, who Bolsonaro supporters see as Enemy Number One.

The hearings are to begin at 3:00 pm local time (1800 GMT) Monday."

That would boost the AD's seat tally in the 230-seat parliament to 89, short of the 116 seats required for a ruling majority.

The Socialists had 23.4 percent, their worst result in decades, trailed closely by Chega (""Enough"") with 22.6 percent which would give each party 58 seats.

Even with the backing of the upstart business-friendly party Liberal Initiative (IL) which won nine seats, the AD would still need the support of Chega to reach a majority to pass legislation.

But Montenegro, 52, a lawyer by profession, has refused any alliance with Chega, saying it is ""unreliable"" and ""not suited to governing"".

Support for Chega has grown in every general election since the party was founded in 2019 by Andre Ventura, a former trainee priest who later became a television football commentator.

It won 1.3 percent of the vote in a general election in 2019, the year it was founded, giving it a seat in parliament - the first time a far-right party had won representation in Portugal's parliament since a coup in 1974 toppled a decades-long rightist dictatorship.

Chega became the third-largest force in parliament in the next general election in 2022 and quadrupled its parliamentary seats last year to 50, cementing its place in Portugal's political landscape.

Like other far-right parties that have gained ground across Europe, Chega has tapped into hostility to immigration and concerns over crime.

There are still four seats left to be assigned representing Portuguese who live abroad, but those results will not be known for days.

Sunday's election was triggered after Montenegro lost a parliamentary vote of confidence in March after less than a year in power.

He called for the vote following allegations of conflicts of interest related to his family's consultancy business, which has several clients holding government contracts.

Montenegro denied any wrongdoing, saying he was not involved in the day-to-day operations of the firm.

The AD formed a minority government after the last election.

It passed a budget that raises pensions and public sector wages, and slashes income taxes for young people because the PS abstained in key votes in parliament. But relations between the two main parties soured after the confidence vote, and it is unclear if a weakened PS will be willing to allow the centre-right to govern this time around.

Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos, a 48-year-old economist, had accused Montenegro of engineering the election ""to avoid explaining himself"" about the firm's activities to a parliamentary enquiry.

After the results were announced, he said he would call an internal party election to pick a new leader.

Montenegro has criticised the immigration policies of the previous Socialist government, accusing it of leaving Portugal in ""bedlam""."

An overall victory for Trzaskowski would be a boost for the centrist government led by former European Council chief Donald Tusk, which has been at loggerheads with the current president.

A victory for Nawrocki would likely extend the political deadlock and analysts predict that fresh parliamentary elections may have to be called.

Trzaskowski was expected to get 31.2 percent of the vote and Nawrocki 29.7 percent in Sunday's first round, according to an Ipsos poll based on 90 percent of the votes. Preliminary results are expected early Monday.

""This result shows... how determined we have to be, how much work lies ahead of us,"" Trzaskowski, 53, told supporters in the southeastern town of Sandomierz.

Nawrocki, 42, struck a defiant tone: ""We must win these elections to prevent one political camp's monopoly of power,"" he said.

The far-right in Poland with its two candidates -- multi-millionaire entrepreneur Slawomir Mentzen and MEP Grzegorz Braun -- tipped to receive more than 20 percent between the two of them.

""This is the greatest success in the history of our political camp,"" Mentzen said.

Wojciech Przybylski, head of the Res Publica foundation, said ""Trzaskowski can't be absolutely sure of winning"".

""The runoff result will depend on turnout and mobilisation among youths who voted for Mentzen"" and candidate Adrian Zandberg, he told AFP.

Wojciech Kuras, 44, said he did not vote for Trzaskowski but might in the runoff.

""It will be hard for Rafal Trzaskowski. This is such a difficult result because if others join together it can be equal,"" said the entrepreneur from Sandomierz.

Tusk said an ""all-or-nothing"" battle had begun.

""It will be a tough fight for every vote. These two weeks will decide the future of our homeland,"" the prime minister said on X.

Political scientist Ewa Marciniak said the electoral campaign would be ""brutal"".

""Each candidate will try to discredit his rival at all costs, by any means necessary,"" she told AFP.

So far, campaigning in the EU and NATO member has largely revolved around foreign policy, showcasing a clash of philosophies over Poland's engagement with the EU and the United States.

The key to the election could be whether supporters of Mentzen, who came third in the exit poll with 14.5 percent, back Nawrocki in the second round.

Poland's head of state is commander-in-chief of the armed forces, steers foreign policy and can introduce and veto legislation. The result will be closely watched across Europe, where Poland has increased its influence under Tusk."

The vote was seen as crucial for the direction of the EU and NATO members bordering war-torn Ukraine.

The ballot came five months after Romania's constitutional court annulled an election over allegations of Russian interference and a massive social media promotion of the far-right frontrunner, who was not allowed to stand again.

Dan, who campaigned for an ""honest"" Romania, gained more than 54 percent of the vote, while US President Donald Trump admirer Simion secured close to 46 percent, according to near complete results.

Dan, 55, told jubilant supporters gathered in a Bucharest park that Romania's ""reconstruction"" would begin on Monday, calling it ""a moment of hope"".

""In today's elections a community of Romanians who want a profound change in Romania won,"" Dan said.

Nationalist George Simion conceded defeat to Nicusor Dan.

""I would like to congratulate my opponent, Nicusor Dan. He has won the election, and this was the will of the Romanian people,"" said Simion, who earlier had declared victory despite exit polls showing Dan ahead."

""As Türkiye, we will continue to stand by our Crimean brothers, sisters and defend their rights at all times,"" the Turkish president concluded his message.

Remembering the 1944 Exile of Crimean Tatars

On May 18, 1944, nearly 250,000 Crimean Tatars were forcibly deported from their homeland to remote parts of Central Asia by Soviet authorities, who accused the entire population of collaborating with Nazi Germany during World War II.

The deportations were carried out under a secret directive from Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. In the middle of night, families were rounded up and loaded into sealed freight trains. The three-day journey was marked by brutal conditions — thousands died en route from hunger, disease, and exhaustion.

Those who survived the journey faced decades of hardship in exile. It’s estimated that nearly half of the deported population perished in the years that followed due to malnutrition, poor living conditions, and limited access to healthcare.

In 1965, Crimean Tatars began organising a peaceful movement to return to their homeland — a struggle that would last more than two decades. Their efforts finally bore fruit in 1991, when Crimea was granted autonomous status within an independent Ukraine.

But in 2014, history took another dark turn. Russia illegally annexed Crimea, a move widely condemned by the international community.

For many Crimean Tatars, the annexation was a painful reminder of past injustices — and the ongoing fight for their rights, recognition, and homeland."

Fidan met his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan to further advance ties across multiple sectors, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.

Meanwhile, according to Turkish diplomatic sources, speaking at the council meeting Fidan emphasised that Türkiye and Saudi Arabia — bound by “historical and human ties” — have proven the strength of their relationship through regional and global challenges.

According to Turkish diplomatic sources, Fidan highlighted at the council meeting that Ankara and Riyadh, bound by deep “historical and human ties,” have consistently reinforced the strength of their partnership through complex regional and global challenges.

“Turkish-Saudi relations, shaped by historical and human ties, have proven their strength and resilience in the face of challenges and difficulties,” he said, stressing the importance Türkiye places on enhancing coordination with Saudi Arabia for regional peace and stability.

5/18/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/487702197bea,Tense presidential face-off as Romania goes to votePolls opened at 7am on Sunday and will close at 9pm while Romanians abroad have been able to vote since Friday.,"Romanians are casting ballots on Sunday in a tense presidential runoff in a high-stakes election rerun that could determine the geopolitical direction of the European Union and the NATO member country.

Sunday’s race pits front-runner George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the right-wing Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, against incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan. It comes months after the cancellation of the previous election plunged Romania into its worst political crisis in decades.

Polls opened at 7 am (0400 GMT) local time and will close at 9 pm (1800 GMT).

Romanians abroad have been able to vote since Friday at polling stations set up in other countries, and more than 730,000 have already cast ballots.

Romania’s political landscape was upended last year when a top court voided the previous election after conservative independent politician, Calin Georgescu, topped first-round polls.

Years of endemic corruption and growing anger toward Romania’s political establishment have fueled a surge in support for anti-establishment figures, reflecting a broader pattern across Europe.

Both Simion and Dan have made their political careers railing against Romania’s old political class.

Most recent local surveys indicate the runoff will be tight, after earlier ones showed Simion holding a lead over Dan, a 55-year-old mathematician who rose to prominence as a civic activist fighting against illegal real estate projects.

Turnout is typically higher in the final round of Romanian presidential elections and is expected to play a decisive role in the outcome on Sunday. In the first round on May 4, the final turnout stood at 9.5 million, or 53 percent of eligible voters, according to official electoral data.

Dan founded the reformist Save Romania Union party in 2016 but later left, and is running independently on a pro-EU ticket reaffirming Western ties, support for Ukraine and fiscal reform.

The presidential role carries a five-year term and significant decision-making powers in national security and foreign policy.

The winner of Sunday’s race will be charged with nominating a new prime minister after Marcel Ciolacu stepped down following the failure of his coalition’s candidate to advance to the runoff. After coming fourth in last year’s cancelled race, Simion backed Georgescu who was banned in March from standing in the redo.

Simion then surged to front-runner in the May 4 first round after becoming the standard-bearer for the right-leaning politics. Simion, also a former activist who campaigned for reunification with neighbouring Moldova, says he would focus on reforms: slashing red tape and reducing bureaucracy and taxes.

But he insists that his main goal is to restore democracy.

“My platform is to return to democracy, to the will of the people,” he said.

The AUR party he leads says it stands for “family, nation, faith, and freedom” and rose to prominence in a 2020 parliamentary election.

It has since grown to become the second-largest party in the Romanian legislature. To his critics, Simion is pro-Russia and his views threaten Romania’s longstanding alliances in the EU and NATO. But in an Associated Press interview, he rejected the accusations, saying Russia is his country’s biggest threat and that he wants Romania to be treated as “equal partners” in Brussels.

“I don’t think he is a pro-Russian candidate, I also don’t think that he’s an anti-Russian candidate,” said Claudiu Tufis, an associate professor of political science at the University of Bucharest. “I think what is driving him is … his focus on what I call identity politics.”

In the first-round vote, Simion won a massive 61 percent of Romania’s large diaspora vote, with his calls to patriotism resonating with Romanians who moved abroad in search of better opportunities.

Hours after voting opened on Friday, Simion accused the Moldovan government of election fraud, claims that were quickly rejected by Moldovan and Romanian authorities. “These statements are intended to sow distrust and hostility, with the aim of influencing the election process,” Romania’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement."

The top two front-runners are Warsaw Mayor Rafał Trzaskowski, a liberal allied with Prime Minister Donald Tusk, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative historian with no prior political experience who is supported by the national conservative Law and Justice party.

Recent opinion polls show Trzaskowski with around 30 percent support and Nawrocki in the mid-20s.

A second round between the two is widely expected to take place on June 1st.

The election is also a test of the strength of other forces, including the far right.

Sławomir Mentzen, a hard-right candidate who blends populist MAGA rhetoric with libertarian economics and a critical stance toward the European Union, has been polling in third place.

Ten other candidates are also on the ballot.

With such a crowded field and a requirement that a candidate receive more than 50 percent of the vote to win outright, a second round seemed all but inevitable.

Polling stations open at 7 a.m. (0500GMT) and close at 9 p.m. (1900GMT).

Exit polls will be released when voting ends, with results expected by Tuesday, possibly Monday.

Polish authorities have reported attempts at foreign interference during the campaign, including denial-of-service attacks targeting parties in Tusk’s coalition on Friday and allegations by a state research institute that political ads on Facebook were funded from abroad.

Although Poland’s prime minister and parliament hold primary authority over domestic policy, the presidency carries substantial power.

The president serves as commander of the armed forces, plays a role in foreign and security policy, and can veto legislation.

A Trzaskowski victory could be expected to end such a standoff. He has pledged to support reforms to the courts and public media, both of which critics say were politicized under Law and Justice.

Nawrocki, who leads a state historical institute, has positioned himself as a defender of conservative values and national sovereignty."
5/17/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/70d14377d0df,Libya’s latest clashes explained: What this round of violence could signalThe assassination of militia leader Abdel Ghani al-Kikli has triggered deadly clashes in Tripoli in what some experts view as a potential turning point in the city’s militia-driven security model.,"Abdel Ghani al-Kikli, one of Tripoli’s most powerful militia commanders, was killed on May 12 during a shootout at the headquarters of the 444th Brigade, a force affiliated with the Ministry of Defense. His death sparked a second wave of clashes the following day between the 444 Brigade and the Special Deterrence Force (Radaa), a rival militia that controls parts of eastern Tripoli, including Mitiga Airport and several key state institutions.

While no official death toll has been released, the Libyan Red Crescent reported recovering at least one body from a main road in the capital.

Who is Abdel Ghani al-Kikli?

Kikli, also known as “Gnewa,” rose to power by forming a brigade in Tripoli’s Abu Salim district, which later became the foundation of the Stability Support Apparatus (SSA), officially established in 2021 by a Presidential Council decree.

“After taking up his position, Gnewa established close contact with Prime Minister Dbeibah,” says Taha Yasin Akar, a political and security analyst specialising in the Middle East.

“As a result, he managed to place his loyalists — directly or indirectly — in many key government positions within the Tripoli-based administration,” he tells TRT World.

But that relationship soured. In recent months, Kikli’s bid to consolidate control over key government posts led him to fall out not just with Dbeibah, but with rival militias.

His death, Akar argues, could trigger “significant changes” in the security model built around armed groups in Tripoli.

How did it come to this?

Libya remains divided between a UN-recognised Government of National Unity (GNU) in Tripoli, led by Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah, and a rival administration in the east backed by General Khalifa Haftar and aligned with the House of Representatives in Benghazi.

The split dates back to the 2011 NATO-backed revolt that toppled and killed longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi, which saw the country plunging into institutional chaos with no unified state.

In the absence of a functioning army, police, or judiciary, local armed groups filled the vacuum, acting as semi-state structures: collecting taxes, interfering in the judiciary, controlling border crossings, and managing energy facilities.

Rather than integrating into a national framework, many militia remained loyal to local commanders, siphoning state resources while contributing little to stability or governance.

“As a result, the boundaries between the state and militias became blurred in Libya, and armed power became the primary source of political legitimacy,” Akar says.

The killing of Abdel Ghani al-Kikli and the clashes that followed could suggest that the foundations of the militia-based security model are beginning to unravel, according to Akar.

“Dbeibah has now gained the ability to make appointments within the government and other key institutions more freely, without pressure from armed groups, and has sent that message clearly to other power players,” he says.

‘No place’ for non-state forces

Following the latest clashes, which involved the 444th and 111th Brigades, forces aligned with the Ministry of Defense, and the Special Deterrence Force, Dbeibah declared that security had been restored. He praised state forces for demonstrating that “legitimate state institutions are capable of protecting the nation and preserving the dignity of its citizens”.

“There is no place in Libya except for state institutions, and no authority except that of the law,” he said.

His office ordered the dismantling of “irregular armed groups” and moved to assert greater control over key checkpoints and security installations.

According to Akar, the Dbeibah administration appears to be moving away from a consensus-based governance model with militias and toward a direct intervention and purge strategy.

“While this may allow the government more freedom in decision-making, it also brings the risk of renewed conflict”, he warns."

Here’s why the Istanbul meeting matters.","The long-running nuclear standoff between Iran and the West has taken a new turn, with fresh rounds of diplomacy unfolding on two fronts. While Iranian and American officials have resumed indirect talks in Muscat, Oman, after President Doanld Trump extended an “olive branch” to Tehran, a separate meeting in Istanbul between Iran and three key European nations—the UK, France, and Germany—has added a new layer of complexity.These three countries, known collectively as the E3, were part of the original 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear agreement also signed by the US, Russia, and China. Their talks with Iran, held this week in Istanbul, suggest a renewed push by Europe to reassert its role in shaping a potential return to the deal, or some form of successor arrangement.Following the meeting, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi described the talks in a post on X as constructive, saying both sides were “determined to sustain and make optimal use of diplomacy.” While British envoy Christian Turner echoed the sentiment, saying the parties reaffirmed their commitment to dialogue and agreed to meet again.

Yet behind the carefully worded diplomatic language lies a more uncertain reality.Experts point out that while the E3 were instrumental in brokering the original JCPOA, their influence has faded since the US unilaterally withdrew from the deal in 2018 under the Trump administration. Since then, the E3 has struggled to define a cohesive Iran policy of their own.

“The E3 countries have not yet managed to define a coherent and relevant ‘Iran policy.’ From Trump 1.0 to Biden, they have always been accustomed to flatly following American positions,” says Theo Nencini, an expert on Iran foreign policy.

Nencini, also a lecturer at Sciences Po Grenoble and Paris Catholic University, believes that unexpected US-Iran direct talks caught Europeans off guard, prompting them to scramble to get involved in the negotiation process despite the fact that “they have always maintained a very strict attitude towards Iran.”

“Today's talks can be read as an attempt by the Europeans to avoid being sidelined by a deal that could eventually reopen Iran to foreign investment,” he tells TRT World. The Istanbul meeting was as much about political positioning as substance. For the E3, it was a way to stay relevant. For Tehran, engaging the Europeans may help strengthen its hand in parallel talks with Washington.

Other analysts agree that E3’s leverage is limited, but not irrelevant. Tehran-based journalist Fatima Karimkhan notes that any meaningful agreement will ultimately require direct US-Iran cooperation

“But the E3 is still important for Iran and they can have some effects on the US and Israel too, so they should be a part of negotiations” though not as prominent as they were through the 2015 agreement process, Karimkhan adds.Still, the writer remains “pretty optimistic” about ongoing US-Iran talks. “The Trump administration needs a big win in the Middle East,” she tells TRT World.

An Iranian source familiar with past nuclear negotiations was more blunt. “They have always privately said that they can not deliver because the US was not there,” he says, speaking on condition of anonymity. The source argues that Europe’s track record, particularly after the US exit from the JCPOA, has left Iranian officials sceptical of any promises made without American involvement. “Iran can’t afford to trust them,” he added.

“They (Iranians) should not expect any fruitful results from these discussions.”

Why Istanbul meet matters: Snapback mechanism

Beyond diplomatic optics, the Istanbul meeting also carried legal and strategic weight. One of the most sensitive issues on the table was the snapback mechanism, a clause in the JCPOA that allows any signatory to invoke UN sanctions if it believes another party is in serious breach of the deal.The clause is tied to UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed the JCPOA ten years ago, and is set to expire in October. Under normal conditions, its expiration should lead to the lifting of all related sanctions. But the snapback mechanism allows any signatory, like one of the E3, to argue that Iran is not in compliance and take the issue to the UN Security Council which should decide in 30 days on whether to keep or remove sanctions relief. If the Security Council could not agree on sanctions relief, then, all previous sanctions will automatically “snap back” into place.

European diplomats have indicated they may invoke this mechanism by August if Iran and the US fail to reach a new deal. However, Nencini believes that “barring any significant upheavals between now and then (which are not impossible, after all),” he does not think E3 will move to trigger it. Their main concern remains Iran’s escalating uranium enrichment. According to IAEA estimates it’s reported to have reached 60 percent purity, far beyond the JCPOA’s original cap and uncomfortably close to weapons-grade levels. Tehran has reacted angrily to the threat. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi warned in an article for the French weekly Le Monde that misuse of the snapback clause could “end Europe's role in the agreement” and escalate tensions in ways that may be “irreversible"".

This week’s Istanbul meeting revealed both the potential and limitations of Europe’s role in the nuclear talks. While the E3 are no longer the driving force they were in 2015, their involvement still matters to Iran, to the US, and to the broader architecture of any future agreement.With the clock ticking toward October’s expiration of Resolution 2231, and the threat of snapback sanctions looming, the window for diplomacy is narrowing. Whether Europe can help bridge the remaining gaps, or merely observe from the sidelines, remains to be seen."

Speaking at the European Political Community summit in Albania, Merz said European allies will continue providing strong support to Ukraine while pursuing diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire.

“The fact that they are meeting today, the first time in three and a half years, is a very small but first positive signal. We have to do more on that, on diplomatic efforts,” Merz said, referring to the Istanbul meeting between Ukrainian and Russian delegations.

He also underlined that Ukraine needs to maintain a strong military position to succeed at the negotiating table. “We have to be very clear on our military support for this country as well. There should be no doubt that we are willing to continue to give our support,” he stressed.

The European Political Community summit brought together leaders from more than 40 European countries and EU institutions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan were among the leaders who attended the summit in Tirana, hosted by Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama.

Phone call with Trump

At a press conference after the summit, Merz told reporters that a group of European leaders, along with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, held a phone call with US President Donald Trump to discuss the latest developments on Russia-Ukraine war.

“The Russian side would have had a good opportunity to hold initial talks this week on a peace preceded by a ceasefire agreement. We are very disappointed that this did not take place,” Merz told reporters, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin's absence from the Istanbul negotiations.

He underlined that European leaders agree with Zelenskyy to continue making offers for talks in the coming days and weeks.

“The diplomatic efforts we have made so far have unfortunately failed due to Russia's unwillingness to take the first steps in the right direction. However, we will not give up. We will continue our efforts, and we will coordinate and maintain strong coordination between Europe and the Americans,” he said.

Austria on Friday praised Türkiye for hosting Istanbul peace talks and its efforts to put an end to the war in Ukraine.

Chancellor Christian Stocker posted on X a photo of himself shaking hands with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the sidelines of a European Political Community summit in the Albanian capital of Tirana.

""Türkiye is a crucial partner for the European Union, and I very much commend Türkiye's role in trying to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.

The negotiations, facilitated by Turkish diplomacy, marked a rare moment of tangible progress in the long-running conflict. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan described the talks as “an important day for world peace,” emphasising Ankara’s ongoing commitment to fostering a lasting peace between the two warring neighbours.

“Today was an important day for world peace,” Fidan wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “As Türkiye, we will continue to make every effort to enable a lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine.”

In addition to the prisoner exchange deal, both sides agreed to share, in writing, the terms and conditions they believe could enable a ceasefire. Fidan said this move was a “confidence-building measure” and that the parties had also agreed in principle to reconvene for further negotiations.

“Parties also have agreed in principle to come together again,” Fidan said. “As Türkiye, we will continue to make every effort to enable a lasting peace between Russia and Ukraine,” he added.

Earlier in the day, Fidan chaired the talks, which took place at Istanbul’s historic Dolmabahce Palace and lasted about 1 hour and 45 minutes, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry. Türkiye’s delegation also included National Intelligence Organisation (MIT) Director Ibrahim Kalin.

""We must seize this opportunity to advance on the path to peace. Every day of delay causes more losses of life,"" Fidan said during his opening speech, addressing delegations from both Russia and Ukraine, as well as Turkish mediators.

Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Russian delegation and an advisor to President Vladimir Putin, echoed Fidan’s optimism at a press conference in Istanbul.

“On the whole, we are satisfied with the results and are ready to continue contacts,” said Medinsky. “We have agreed on three things. First, in the coming days, there will be a large-scale exchange of prisoners of war — 1,000 for 1,000 people.”

He added that Moscow had taken note of a Ukrainian request for a potential direct meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, and said both sides had committed to outlining their respective visions for a ceasefire in detailed written form.

Rustem Umerov, head of the Ukrainian delegation, also welcomed the outcomes, calling the prisoner swap “the key outcome of the meeting.”

Speaking to reporters, Umerov said the Istanbul talks focused on three critical tracks: reaching a ceasefire, pursuing humanitarian initiatives such as prisoner exchanges, and preparing for a possible meeting between President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and President Vladimir Putin.

“Our colleagues are in contact and will exchange all the documents. Now we need to exchange people, and we will inform you what is next,” Umerov said.

The Russian delegation was led by Vladimir Medinskiy, presidential aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and included Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate Director Igor Kostyukov, Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin, and other officials.

Speaking at the 6th European Political Community (EPC) Summit in the Albanian capital Tirana on Friday, Erdogan emphasised that ""the visa practices such as Schengen, which limit the mobility of our citizens and, consequently, the circulation of goods, services, and capital, must be re-evaluated.""

He said Türkiye believes that ""updating our Customs Union with the EU will contribute to the security of supply chains."" Erdogan emphasised that the Customs Union should be modernised to better reflect current trade realities and mutual interests.

He added that the ongoing restrictions not only hinder citizens' movement but also negatively affect commercial ties and broader economic integration with Europe.

""As a European continent, we must start transformation at home based on principles of indivisible security, fairer distribution of prosperity,"" he noted.

""As we discuss the future of Europe’s security at this critical time, we find the EU's efforts to develop its defence industry beneficial,"" he also stressed.

He underscored that European security cannot be solely dependent on external actors, and that the continent must accept collective responsibility for its peace and stability. -

Netanyahu’s aggressive policies in Gaza slammed

Erdogan also urged European countries to show the necessary willingness and interest in helping establish a ceasefire in Gaza. He warned that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's aggressive and uncompromising policies endanger the lives of people of all faiths in Gaza and throughout the region.

""Over 2 million people in Gaza have been condemned to hunger, and the international community's silence in the face of this tragedy is incompatible with human dignity,"" he said.

He emphasised the importance of immediate and sustained humanitarian aid deliveries, as well as the need to rebuild Gaza to make it livable again.

""Our main objective must be to implement a two-state solution as the only viable and sustainable path to peace,"" Erdogan added.

The Israeli army has pursued a brutal offensive in Gaza since October 7, 2023, killing some 53,000 Palestinians so far, most of them women and children.

The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.

Israel also faces a genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war on the enclave.

Regarding the war in Ukraine, Erdogan emphasised that encouraging both Russia and Ukraine without imposing conditions, given the sensitivity of the process, is key to achieving a just and lasting peace.

He said recent talks with world leaders such as Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy have provided an important opportunity to end hostilities.

Responding to a question from reporters about Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations, Erdogan said: “Together with my brother (Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama), we will call for peace to the whole world from Albania.”

""We believe that the opportunity before us must not be squandered. Dialogue channels between Ukraine and Russia must remain open,"" he said. Erdogan was welcomed by Rama at the entrance to Skanderbeg Square, where the summit was hosted.

Turkish-German leaders discuss bilateral ties, global issues

The Turkish President also met with the German Chancellor on the sidelines of the EPC summit to discuss bilateral relations as well as regional and global developments.

According to the Türkiye Directorate of Communications, Erdogan said during the meeting that Türkiye and Germany have deep-rooted and multidimensional relations and that the two countries will work to advance their cooperation in the coming period.

Erdogan further said that Türkiye will persist in its utmost effort to ensure that the ongoing Ukrainian war ends with fair and lasting peace and that efforts for peace should be increased, not letting the window of opportunity be missed.

The Turkish leader also invited Friedrich Merz to Türkiye, and the German chancellor agreed to visit as soon as possible.

Europe must reclaim its visionary ideals, with Türkiye by its side: Albanian PM

Meanwhile, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said for the visionaries of the European project, “Türkiye would’ve been an indispensable partner in any union of perpetual peace” – but that project “failed.”

Drawing on Enlightenment thought and European political history, Rama cited one of the earliest proposals for a united Europe: an 18th-century plan by the French diplomat and philosopher Abbe de Saint-Pierre.

After the War of the Spanish Succession and the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Saint-Pierre envisioned a federation of European states – a “Union of Perpetual Peace” that would render war obsolete.

""His project even included cooperation with Russia, as well as with the Balkan and Mediterranean states then under Ottoman rule,"" said Rama.

“So I guess that for the visionary Abbe, today’s Türkiye would also be an indispensable partner in a union of perpetual peace.” But that project ""failed,"" he added.

Rama’s rhetorical turn toward Enlightenment values – invoking not only Saint-Pierre but also Voltaire and Kant – added depth to his argument. He lamented that the original peace project was ""killed by light interests and petty caprice,"" and warned that Europe today risks falling into a similar trap.

""Even today, the myth of Europa persists, and the resemblance to the Europe gathered here today is striking. The dream of perpetual peace has been replaced by the nightmare of perpetual war.""

“Here in the Balkans, we have survived war, bombs, territorial conflicts, destruction and disruption,” he said. “It’s happened in our lifetimes, not in some distant black and white documentary archive, and we have learned that peace has no competitors.”

The speech offered a contrast between two Europes: one defined by militarisation and fear, and another rooted in enlightenment, human reason, and a belief in the humanity of one’s enemies, even historical ones.

“The enemies of peace should not drag us into the glorification of weapons,” he warned. “While we rightfully think about the Europe of resistance, defence and new military capabilities, we must not forget the other Europe – the Europe of enlightenment ... and the quest for perpetual peace, not just among ourselves, but even with our enemies.”"

""I didn't ask them about that. I thought it was the right thing to do. I've been given a lot of credit for doing it. Look, we want Syria to succeed,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, shortly after departing Abu Dhabi at the close of a four-day Middle East trip.

President Donald Trump said the US lifted sanctions on Syria to promote a ""fresh start"" for the country.

Trump announced on May 13 the end to the “brutal and crippling” sanctions on Syria in response to demands from Alsharaa's allies in Türkiye and Saudi Arabia.

Syria first came under a broad range of US sanctions at the end of the 1970s as dictator Hafez al Assad took power through an internal party coup and seized the presidency in 1970.

The intensity of US sanctions increased in 2011 as human rights abuses by the brutal Bashar al Assad regime made global headlines in the wake of civil war.

Speaking at a Gulf-US summit in the Saudi capital Riyadh, Trump said the decision came after talking with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

“After discussing the situation with Crown Prince Mohammed and President Erdogan of Türkiye, I'm also ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria to give them a fresh start. It gives (Syria) a chance for greatness,"" he said.

Erdogan said the US president's decision to lift sanctions on Syria carries historic importance.

During the meeting, Erdogan expressed Ankara’s desire for Syria to be a stable, prosperous nation that collaborates with its regional neighbours and poses no threat to them, citing Türkiye's ongoing efforts to achieve this goal."

Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said that he had a ""good conversation"" with acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on Thursday evening.

""Deeply appreciate his condemnation of the Pahalgam terrorist attack,"" Jaishankar said in a post on social media platform X.

But Afghan foreign minister's statement made no mention of the attack in Pahalgam, a tourist hotspot in India-administered Kashmir.

Afghan foreign ministry spokesman Hafiz Zia Ahmad Takal said Muttaqi had ""expressed hope for further strengthening relations, reiterating Afghanistan's commitment to a balanced foreign policy and constructive engagement with all sides"".

India has accused Pakistan of backing the Pahalgam attackers who killed 26 people. Pakistan has denied the charge and called for an independent probe.

Last week, India and Pakistan fought a four-day conflict, which sparked global concerns that it could spiral into a full-blown war before a ceasefire was brokered on Saturday.

Military exchanges from May 7 left nearly 70 people, including dozens of people, dead on both sides.

Afghanistan last week warned India and Pakistan that escalation was not ""in the interest of the region"" after the nuclear-armed rivals exchanged artillery fire."

Kiev said it is seeking an ""unconditional ceasefire"" in the fighting. Moscow says it wants to address the ""root causes"" of the conflict and revive failed 2022 negotiations.

The meeting started following the conclusion of the interaction between Turkish, US, and Ukrainian delegations hosted by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.

In an opening speech at Russia-Ukraine peace talks, Turkish Foreign Minister Fidan says: 'We must seize this opportunity to advance on the path to peace'

He sat at the head of a table in front of Turkish, Russian and Ukrainian flags -- with Russian and Ukrainian delegations facing each other, footage from the room showed.

Both sessions took place at the Presidential Dolmabahce Office, a historic venue frequently used for major diplomatic engagements.

The meetings will bring together senior figures from each country.

Representing Türkiye will be Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who has played a central role in coordinating peace efforts.

The US delegation will be led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, while Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov will head Kiev’s team. On the Russian side, Presidential Adviser Vladimir Medinsky will lead the delegation.

The Ukrainian delegation also includes Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya, Security Service Deputy Head Oleksandr Poklad, and Deputy Chief of the Foreign Intelligence Service Oleh Luhovskyi.

The Russian team comprises Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, General Staff Intelligence Director Igor Kostyukov, and Deputy Defense Minister Aleksandr Fomin, reflecting the talks’ weight and complexity.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that a meeting between Russian and US presidents is ""undoubtedly necessary,"" but that it must be thoroughly prepared.

Speaking at a press briefing in Moscow, Peskov said bilateral relations, international issues, and the Ukrainian crisis should be the main topics of the meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.

""Such a meeting is undoubtedly necessary both from the point of view of bilateral Russian-American relations and from the point of view of discussing and having a serious conversation at the highest level on international affairs and regional issues, including, of course, the crisis over Ukraine,"" he said.

Comey, who was fired by Trump in 2017, later took down the post on Thursday, saying he was unaware the apparent political message could have been associated with violence.

In US parlance the number 86 can be used as verb meaning to throw somebody out of a bar for being drunk or disorderly, and 47 is code for Trump, the 47th president.

Some Trump supporters interpreted the message as one to violently remove Trump from office, including by assassination.

The Merriam-Webster Dictionary says on its website that one recent meaning of the term was ""to kill"" but that it had not adopted that ""due to its relative recency and sparseness of use.""

The Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting the president, said it was aware of Comey's post but did not assess its meaning.

""The Secret Service vigorously investigates anything that can be taken as a potential threat against our protectees. We are aware of the social media posts by the former FBI director and we take rhetoric like this very seriously. Beyond that, we do not comment on protective intelligence matters,"" Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement.

'Cool shell formation on my beach walk'

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Secret Service, said on X that DHS and Secret Service were ""investigating this threat and will respond appropriately.""

Current FBI Director Kash Patel said on X that his agency was in communication with the Secret Service about the post and ""will provide all necessary support.""

Others were more explicit in assigning a malign meaning to Comey's post, with White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino saying it was a call to assassinate Trump.

Comey posted an Instagram photo of the number 8647 formed by seashells on the beach.

""Cool shell formation on my beach walk,"" Comey said.

But after the uproar from Trump supporters, Comey took the post down, saying he had assumed it was merely a ""political message.""

""I didn't realise some folks associate those numbers with violence. It never occurred to me but I oppose violence of any kind so I took the post down,"" Comey said.

Early in his first term, in May 2017, Trump fired Comey, who as FBI director had been leading an investigation into the Trump 2016 presidential campaign's possible collusion with Russia to help Trump get elected."

""I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,"" Trump said during his visit to Qatar on Thursday.

""I said to him, Tim you're my friend, I treated you very good. You're coming here with $500 billion, but now you're building all over India,"" he said, referring to Apple's plan announced in February to invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years.

Trump said he informed Cook that he does not want him to build production facilities in India, and that Apple will be ""upping their production in the United States.""

The US president claimed that selling American goods in the world's most populous country is ""very difficult"" because India has one of the highest tariff barriers in the world.

However, he noted that while the Asian country looks for a deal on import duties, India has offered them a ""no-tariff"" deal.

Trump's remarks came after Tim Cook said earlier this month that the majority of Apple's products to be sold in the US in the coming months will be sourced from India and Vietnam rather than China, which has been the target of US President Donald Trump's highest tariffs.

""We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,"" Cook said.

The primary production location ""for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the US"" will be Vietnam in the meantime.

Cook noted that the great bulk of all products sold outside the US will continue to be manufactured in China.

Apple is among the most impacted tech firms in the US, with its shares falling by around 5.1 percent since the tariffs were announced.

Due to low production costs, the majority of Apple products are now manufactured in China.

The Trump administration has repeatedly stated that it wants Apple to move production to the US.

Earlier this week, the US and China agreed to a sweeping rollback of punitive tariffs for an initial 90-day period, signaling a rare moment of relief in their protracted trade conflict and raising hopes for longer-term economic stability."

On Friday, a flurry of meetings is expected in Istanbul involving delegations from Russia, Ukraine, the United States and Türkiye, according to Turkish Foreign Ministry sources.

While trilateral talks are planned between the US, Ukraine and Türkiye as well as between Russia, Ukraine and Türkiye, it remains unclear whether a four-way meeting will take place.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan is set to host US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov and Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

The negotiations — facilitated by Türkiye — mark the first attempt at direct talks between the warring sides since early 2022.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived early on Thursday in Ankara for a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan before deciding on Kiev's participation in the talks.

Following the talks, Zelenskyy confirmed Ukraine's participation, despite expressing concerns about the Russian delegation's composition. He announced that Defence Minister Umerov would lead the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul.

""Despite the rather low level of the Russian delegation, out of respect for (US) President (Donald) Trump, for the high-level Turkish delegation and President Erdogan, and wishing to attempt at least the first steps toward de-escalation and an end to the war, I decided to send our delegation to Istanbul — though not in full,"" Zelenskyy said.

He praised Türkiye's ""multifaceted"" role in diplomatic efforts and emphasised that Ukraine’s visit began with ""a very meaningful conversation at the highest level.""

Russia says goal is long-term peace

Meanwhile, the Russian delegation, led by presidential aide Medinsky, arrived at Istanbul's Dolmabahce Palace, where the talks are based.

Medinsky said his team has full authority to negotiate and sees the new round of talks as a continuation of the 2022 Istanbul process.

""The goal of direct negotiations with the Ukrainian side is to achieve long-term peace,"" he said, calling for a constructive approach.

In a televised briefing for Russian media in Istanbul, Medinsky late on Thursday announced: ""Tomorrow morning, literally from 10 am, we will be waiting for the Ukrainian side, which has to show up to the meeting.""

""We are ready to work,"" Medinsky said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app. He said his delegation had held ""productive"" talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Fidan.

President Erdogan, in remarks following his meeting with Zelenskyy, reaffirmed Türkiye's commitment to facilitating dialogue and said Ankara would be willing to host talks between the Russian and Ukrainian leaders when they are ready.

He described the moment as a historic opportunity for peace and stressed the urgency of reaching common ground to prevent further bloodshed.

After leaving the informal NATO foreign ministers meeting in the Turkish resort city Antalya, Turkish Foreign Minister Fidan met with the Russian delegation in Istanbul's Dolmabahce Palace.

Shortly after, the Turkish Foreign Ministry announced Friday's expected meetings.

Meanwhile, President Trump, speaking from Abu Dhabi on the final stop of his Middle East tour, said he would ""probably"" return to Washington on Friday but left open the possibility of a surprise visit to Istanbul.

He had suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin's attendance was contingent on his own, saying: ""Obviously, he wasn't going to go. He was going to go, but he thought I was going to go. He wasn't going if I wasn’t there. And I don’t believe anything is going to happen, whether you like it or not, until he and I get together.

While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy arrived in Ankara and could potentially travel to Istanbul for the talks brokered by Türkiye, there was no clarity if Russian President Vladimir Putin would attend the talks.

“The difficulties of a leadership-level meeting show that negotiating conditions for a peace deal will be very tough between the two sides,” Abdullah Erboga, an Istanbul-based academic and expert on international affairs, tells TRT World.

The latest Istanbul talks – coming more than three years after the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022 - are being seen as the first serious attempt to end the conflict, the bloodiest in Europe since World War II.

US President Donald Trump – who is on a Middle East tour – announced on board Air Force One that “if something happened, I’d go (to Istanbul) on Friday if it was appropriate”. His comments are being read as clear signs that the US and other stakeholders have not yet given up hopes of a last-minute trip to Istanbul by Putin.

There is also a possibility that Trump might visit Istanbul or Ankara to meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and make a public call to Putin to show up for the Ukraine meeting.

""I don't know that he (Putin) would be there if I'm not there. I know he would like me to be there, and that's a possibility. If we could end the war, I'd be thinking about that,"" Trump told reporters accompanying him on his tour.

While there are big hopes for a positive outcome from the talks, analysts say there are real differences between the expectations of the two warring sides.

While Ukrainians expect at least a 30-day truce from the Istanbul meeting, the Russians are seeking a peace deal on the lines of the 2022 draft agreement in Istanbul, which proposed Kiev’s neutrality and the acceptance of Russian as the second official language of Ukraine. Ukraine would also consider reducing its army and paying attention to Russia’s security concerns, according to the draft.

But the draft was not ratified as Ukraine refused to recognise Russian sovereignty in some occupied regions, including Crimea.

Sergei Markov, a leading Russian academic and a former advisor to Putin, sees the opportunity for successful negotiations in Istanbul as “quite small” because of various reasons ranging from Zelenskyy’s “reluctance” to hold serious talks with Moscow to big differences between the two sides on what a ceasefire would serve.

Russia strongly believes that Kiev has a hidden agenda in its unconditional ceasefire demand backed by Western powers, which is to address their growing military crisis, Markov tells TRT World. He feels that Zelenskyy wants to use the ceasefire period as an opportunity to invite British, French and other Western troops into Ukrainian territory.

Zelenskyy is also seeking the deployment of US air-defence systems in Poland and Romania, the two Eastern European neighbours to Ukraine, to protect both Kiev’s troops and Western soldiers, according to Markov.

In recent months, Ukraine has faced military setbacks across different fronts.

Moscow considers the 30-day ceasefire call without conditions as the proposal of “all of the Russian enemies,” says Markov, but he also adds that the Kremlin is not against a ceasefire if it provides clear guarantees that no foreign troops and military aid would be sent to Ukraine.

“Zelenskyy (has) come to Türkiye only because of Trump’s pressure,” not for a real peace deal, says Markov.

Prior to his trip to Türkiye, Zelenskyy indicated that ""Ukraine is ready for any format of negotiations, and we are not afraid of meetings.”

But a Wall Street Journal report, citing “officials briefed on Kiev’s position”, claimed that Ukrainian negotiators only aim to talk about a ceasefire without discussing any other matters.

On the other hand, Russians do not want to have a concrete peace deal at this stage when Moscow has an upper hand in war fronts, says Erboga, adding that Moscow’s low level representation in the Istanbul meeting proves this point.

Also, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s definition of the Istanbul negotiations as “intrigue” shows Russian hesitation for a peace deal, according to Erboga.

The Russian analyst says that beyond disagreement on calling an unconditional ceasefire, there are also other problem areas, particularly on the content of a possible peace deal.

He was referring to Moscow’s position of embracing the 2022 draft agreement in Istanbul and Ukraine’s refusal to accept it.

The process of signing a peace deal based on the 2022 Istanbul negotiations was “interrupted” because of both Zelenskyy’s reluctance to reach an agreement with Russia and opposition from British and US leaders, David Johnson and Joe Biden, according to Markov.

Can both sides return to the Istanbul format?

“For Russia, it’s important to continue the Istanbul negotiations to specify those conditions of a possible deal produced by the 2022 talks,” says Markov.

Among those conditions is demilitarisation of Ukraine, which should reduce its army size and heavy weapons to a level where it can not target territories deep inside Russia, he says.

He also mentions Ukraine must end “anti-Russia measures” like restrictions on the use of the Russian language, and also dismantle far-right groups like the Azov Brigade.

Markov sees these alleged Ukrainian policies as the “root causes” of the conflict, an opinion similar to Putin’s call that any negotiations with Ukrainians should aim to “eliminate the root causes”.

“Russia wants to continue those negotiations with Ukraine to reach a peace deal,” says the analyst, referring to the Istanbul format. “Russia clearly rejects the Western narrative that Moscow is the aggressor,” says Markov.

But other analysts suggest that no matter who is the aggressor, the current Ukrainian military situation is much better than in 2022, as they hold more Russian territory than initial days of Moscow's “special military operation”.

This means Ukraine is not willing to accept Russian conditions from three years ago.

Some even suggest that Zelenskyy is open to visiting Ankara rather than Istanbul “so as to mark a break with that line of negotiations.”

Both Russians and Ukrainians have blamed each other for not reaching a peace deal so far.

Analysts say that both sides want to show Trump their willingness to reach a deal, but blame the other party for preventing the occurrence of an agreement.

“Zelenskyy plans to show Trump that Russians are not willing to reach a peace deal, so the Trump administration can go back to policies of the Biden administration,” says Markov.

But Western analysts also see Putin’s recent “direct talks” offer as a political tactic to show his willingness to reach a peace deal with Ukraine to the US president."

Also on Thursday, a Russian delegation arrived in Türkiye for the negotiations on a possible ceasefire with Ukraine, the Russian RIA Novosti news agency reported.

The bilateral meeting and the inter-delegation working lunch, held behind closed doors, lasted 2 hours and 45 minutes, according to Anadolu Agency.

The closed-door meeting was also attended by Türkiye’s National Defence Minister Yasar Guler, National Intelligence Organisation head Ibrahim Kalin, and Akif Cagatay Kilic, chief presidential advisor on foreign policy and security.

Earlier on X, Türkiye’s Communications Director Fahrettin Altun also said Erdogan and Zelenskyy are expected to discuss the latest developments in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, addressing the situation from all angles.

During the visit, Erdogan is also expected to stress Türkiye's call for an immediate ceasefire and the start of peace negotiations, he added."

Speaking to Anadolu Agency on Thursday during the Russia-Islamic World: KazanForum in Tatarstan, Gurcan emphasised that ending the war is essential for Moscow to unlock broader economic opportunities.

""Throughout the conflict, Türkiye has continued its trade relations with Russia within the framework of international sanctions,"" he said. ""Looking ahead, I believe Türkiye is well-positioned to capitalise on the new trade dynamics that peace could bring.""

He added that peace would not only benefit Türkiye’s economy but also contribute to broader regional prosperity.

“A successful outcome from these talks could create real momentum, not just for trade, but for global stability,” Gurcan said.

Gurcan said the Russia-Islamic World event brought together the Islamic world to showcase halal products, and that the event is important for Türkiye in developing economic relations.

The deputy minister noted that the trade volume between Türkiye and Russia reached $53 billion as of the latest figures.

“We believe such events are significant to achieve the $100 billion trade volume target set by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and President Vladimir Putin,” he said. “We’re holding talks with our Turkish firms, which are also showcasing their products at the forum, about relations with Russia and Tatarstan.”"

“Now, after three years of immense suffering, there is finally a window of opportunity,” Hakan Fidan said in his welcoming speech at the opening of an informal NATO foreign ministers meeting.

Russia and Ukraine are expected to hold direct peace talks in Istanbul — the first in nearly two years — with Türkiye once again playing host and mediator.

“The talks in Istanbul, hopefully, may open a new chapter,” Fidan said.

Fidan also stressed the need to establish a security network across NATO stretching from the US state of Texas to the Turkish capital, Ankara.

Speaking to reporters on day two of the informal NATO meeting, Fidan stressed the many significant developments unfolding in the Euro-Atlantic region.

""As allied partners, today we will have important discussions ranging from how to manage defence burden-sharing, how to strengthen our defence industry base, and how to bring peace to Ukraine.”

The allies will focus on strengthening defence cooperation and advancing efforts to achieve peace in Ukraine, he said.

Fidan added that the meeting would also lay the groundwork for June’s NATO summit set to be held in The Hague.

With diplomacy unfolding simultaneously in Antalya and Istanbul, Türkiye is asserting itself not only as a key NATO ally but as a diplomatic hub with increasing influence over the resolution of international conflicts.

Fidan also emphasised that Türkiye will continue to play a crucial role in European security.

“As NATO's second-largest military, Türkiye will continue to play a crucial role in the European security architecture through its military capabilities and defence industry infrastructure,” Fidan said.

He underlined that the discussions in Antalya reaffirmed NATO’s leading role in the Euro-Atlantic security architecture, adding that Europe’s security cannot be considered separately from NATO.

“In such a period, our expectation is that all steps in the field of security should be taken without unnecessary repetition, divergence, or detachment from NATO,” Fidan said, adding that they raised these issues in both alliance-wide meetings and bilateral talks."

The talks, which mark the first direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in nearly two years, are set to take place in Türkiye under Ankara’s mediation. They come amid a flurry of diplomatic activity, with both NATO and US officials pointing to Türkiye’s unique position as a trusted and neutral venue for dialogue.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday told reporters that President Putin chaired a strategic meeting on Wednesday night involving key figures from Russia’s security and diplomatic establishment.

“Before the departure of our delegation to Istanbul yesterday evening, President Putin held a meeting on preparations for the upcoming negotiations with the Ukrainian side,” Peskov said in Moscow.

The gathering included Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, newly appointed Defense Minister Andrey Belousov, Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, and Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoygu, along with the heads of Russia’s intelligence and internal security agencies.

The meeting reflected the gravity Moscow attaches to the negotiations, which observers say could determine the next phase of the war or a potential diplomatic off-ramp.

Composition of Russian delegation revealed

According to an official decree, the Russian delegation to the Istanbul talks will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

Other members include Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) head Igor Kostyukov, and Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin. The delegation will be supported by a group of technical and legal experts.

The composition reflects a cross-section of Russia’s military, diplomatic, and intelligence leadership, suggesting Moscow is prepared to engage in serious and possibly wide-ranging discussions.

Türkiye’s role reaffirmed as diplomatic hub

The decision to hold the talks in Istanbul underscores Türkiye’s growing role as a diplomatic power broker. Ankara previously hosted Russian and Ukrainian delegations in March 2022, where a draft agreement was tentatively reached before the process stalled.

At the time, Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia claimed Kyiv withdrew from the talks following a visit from then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who reportedly discouraged any premature agreement with Moscow. The renewed talks now offer a second chance for diplomacy under changed regional and global circumstances.

While Ukraine has not yet officially confirmed the final composition of its delegation, sources close to the matter say President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has approved the talks and discussions will begin under international observation.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also endorsed the initiative, saying Washington supports “any mechanism that results in a just peace.”

With NATO foreign ministers gathered simultaneously in Antalya, the diplomatic spotlight remains firmly on Türkiye — a country balancing its alliance commitments with a proven capacity to speak to all sides.

As the delegations convene in Istanbul, the world watches to see if this renewed effort can bring an end to one of the most dangerous conflicts of the 21st century."

The US has a preliminary agreement with the UAE to allow it to import 500,000 of Nvidia's most advanced AI chips a year, starting this year, it was reported on Wednesday.

The deal would boost the country's construction of data centres vital to developing artificial intelligence models. But the agreement has provoked national security concerns among sectors of the US government, and the terms could change, sources said.

A string of business agreements has been inked during Trump's four-day swing through the Gulf region, including a deal for Qatar Airways to purchase up to 210 Boeing widebody jets, a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in US arms sales to the kingdom.

The trip has also brought a flurry of diplomacy. Trump made a surprise announcement on Tuesday that the US will remove longstanding sanctions on Syria and subsequently met with Syrian President Ahmed Alsharaa.

On Thursday, Trump will address US troops at the Al Udeid Air Base, which is in the desert southwest of Doha and hosts the largest US military facility in the Middle East. He then flies to Abu Dhabi to meet with UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and other leaders.

AI is likely to be a focus for the final leg of Trump's trip.

Former President Joe Biden's administration had imposed strict oversight of exports of US AI chips to the Middle East and other regions. Among the Biden administration's fears were that the prized semiconductors would be diverted to China and buttress Beijing's military strength.

Trump has made improving ties with some Gulf countries a key goal of his administration. If all the proposed chip deals in Gulf states, and the UAE in particular, come together, the region would become a third power centre in global AI competition after the United States and China."

Russia's delegation arrived in Türkiye on Thursday for the negotiations on a possible ceasefire with Ukraine, the Russian RIA Novosti news agency reported.

US President Donald Trump said he could still travel to Türkiye if the first direct peace talks between Russia and Ukraine make progress.

""You know, if something happened, I'd go on Friday,"" Trump said in Qatar.

Andriy Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, said on the Telegram app that the 10 a.m. (0700 GMT) start of the talks ""was not planned and was not true"".

Talks to be held in Istanbul hopefully may open a new chapter,' says Turkish foreign minister on Thursday peace negotiations between Ukraine

NATO chief Mark Rutte said “Türkiye plays a big role here because it has good relations with all relevant partners and is seen as a serious venue.”

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had challenged Putin to meet him in person in Istanbul, but the Russian delegation names only a lower-level team.

Putin had proposed holding talks on May 15 in Istanbul as a counter-offer after Ukraine and European nations last week called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire.

Zelenskyy agreed, but said this week that if Putin did not attend himself, it would signal he was not genuinely interested in peace.

""This is his war... Therefore, the negotiations should be with him,"" Zelensky said.

Putin held a meeting with his foreign and defense ministers as well as intelligence and military chiefs ahead of the talks with Ukraine in Istanbul, the Kremlin said Thursday.

""Before the departure of our delegation to Istanbul yesterday evening, President Putin held a meeting on preparations for the upcoming negotiations with the Ukrainian side,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.

The Wednesday night gathering was attended by members of the Russian negotiating team, as well as Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrey Belousov, Russian Guard head Viktor Zolotov, Security Council Secretary Sergey Shoygu, Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov, and Federal Security Service head Alexander Bortnikov, said Peskov.

Putin on Wednesday signed an order on the composition of his country’s delegation for the direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on Thursday.

Tens of thousands have been killed since the offensive started in February 2022. Russia has occupied about a fifth of Ukraine's territory in what is one of Europe's worst conflicts since World War 2.

Medinsky is seen as influential in advancing Russia's historical claims over Ukrainian territory.

The other three negotiators were named as Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin and Igor Kostyukov, director of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency.

European leaders have said new sanctions will be quickly imposed on Russia if the Istanbul talks do not produce results.

On the eve of the talks, Zelenskyy said he would decide Ukraine's next ""steps"" based on who represents Moscow.

""Ukraine is ready for any format of negotiations, and we are not afraid of meetings. Tomorrow ""in Türkiye,"" Zelensky said. ""I am waiting to see who will arrive from Russia. Then I will decide what steps Ukraine should take.""

Russia insists the talks address what it calls the ""root causes"" of the conflict, including the ""denazification"" and demilitarisation of Ukraine.

It has also repeated that Ukraine must cede territory occupied by Russian troops.

Kiev said it will not recognise its territories as Russian — though Zelenskyy has acknowledged that Ukraine might only get them back through diplomatic means.

US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, will be in Istanbul on Friday. Rubio met Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga at a NATO meeting in Türkiye on Wednesday.

And US President Donald Trump on Wednesday indicated he could take a mediation role in Türkiye.

""I don't know that he (Putin) would be there if I'm not there,"" Trump told reporters accompanying him on a Middle East tour.

""I know he would like me to be there, and that's a possibility. If we could end the war, I'd be thinking about that,"" he said."

""Ukraine is ready for any format of negotiations and we are not afraid of meetings,"" Zelenskyy said on Wednesday in a video address on Telegram, as the Turkish metropolis of Istanbul prepares to host the first direct peace talks between the two countries since March 2022.

Zelenskyy said he held several meetings with his team on the format of the talks with Russia.

""I expect who will arrive from Russia, and then I will determine what steps Ukraine should take,"" he said, arguing that ""signals"" they are receiving from the media in Moscow are ""not convincing yet.""

“But we also hear that (US) President (Donald) Trump is considering the possibility of being in Türkiye. So, this could be the strongest argument. A week can really change a lot, but maybe,"" he said. ""All this is being decided now.""

A senior Ukrainian official said late on Wednesday that Zelenskyy was on his way to take part in talks.

""We're on the way,"" the official, who asked not to be identified owing to the sensitivity of the situation, told Reuters news agency. He said Zelenskyy was headed to the Turkish capital Ankara.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, signed an order on the composition of his country's delegation.

The order, which was posted on the Kremlin website, read that the delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, and will also include Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin, Director of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian General Staff Igor Kostyukov, and Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin.

The list did not include Putin himself.

US officials also confirmed Trump's absence from the talks, following Putin's delegation announcement.

Thursday could mark a pivotal moment in global efforts to halt the Russia-Ukraine war as their leaders are expected to hold direct talks in the Turkish city of Istanbul.

The potentially historic meeting represents the most advanced stage of negotiations since the two sides were brought together in March 2022 by the same mediator, Türkiye, a reflection of the level of trust Ankara enjoys with both Russia and Ukraine.

This time, it was Putin who proposed a meeting in Türkiye, making the announcement in a Sunday press conference as he countered Ukraine and European nations' demand for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.

President Erdogan welcomed Russia's support for restarting peace talks from where they paused in Istanbul in March 2022, reaffirming Türkiye's commitment to peace efforts.

Trump also urged Zelenskyy to ""immediately"" take up the Russian proposal for direct talks.

5/14/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/6d192ea757a5,"US reboots Syria policy in 'watershed moment' as Trump lifts sanctionsAnalysts describe President Trump’s decision to lift all sanctions on Syria as a turning point that could reshape Middle East diplomacy, reignite regional cooperation, and offer Damascus a chance to rejoin the international fold.","In a move described as “historic” and “pivotal,” US President Donald Trump has announced the complete lifting of US sanctions on Syria, in a major policy shift, positioning the decision as a bid to give Damascus “a fresh start.”

Trump made the surprise announcement at the Gulf-US summit in Riyadh, revealing that he made the decision after discussions with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Later on Wednesday, President Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed Alsharaa in a meeting hosted by Saudi Crown Prince bin Salman with President Erdogan joining by phone—marking the first meeting between a sitting US president and a Syrian leader in a quarter-century.

The policy shift represents a dramatic recalibration of US engagement in the Middle East. For decades, Washington's posture toward Syria has been one of isolation and coercion. That has now been upended by a White House open to the idea of resetting ties with Damascus under a new government, and to empower regional players—particularly Türkiye and Saudi Arabia—as the architects of this new order, according to analysts.

“It is a watershed moment in Syrian history. I would say if December 8 was extremely significant for Syria, then May 14 is another such day,” Mehmet Ozkan, Professor of International Relations at the Joint War Institute at Türkiye’s National Defence University, told TRT World. On December 8, 2024, Syria’s then-opposition ousted Bashar al-Assad’s government, bringing an end to more than half a century of Assad family rule in Syria.

“It is extremely important. Lifting all the sanctions means that the United States wants to engage with the region in a different way. Especially during the Biden era, the US looked at the Middle East only through Israel. Now, with Trump, he’s looking beyond Israel—to the Gulf countries, Türkiye, Syria,” said Ozkan describing the moment as indicative of a broader recalibration of US influence in the region.

Trump stated that he was encouraged by the Turkish President and Saudi Crown Prince to meet his Syrian counterpart. The US President urged Sharaa to normalise ties with longtime foe Israel, just like the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco did under the US-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020, the White House press secretary posted on X.

“It’s a new policy,” Ozkan said. “Trump is looking from a much higher level, delegating Syria’s future to regional actors like Türkiye. That’s a big shift in Washington’s strategic culture.”

Türkiye’s rising diplomatic capital

President Trump explicitly credited Türkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan — along with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — for influencing his decision. Ankara’s role has drawn considerable praise.

Experts say this recognition reflects Türkiye’s elevated role in post-conflict regional diplomacy. Erdogan reportedly pushed for a rapprochement with Damascus since Syria’s political transition began in December last year.

“Türkiye’s involvement has been extremely critical. Since December 8, Türkiye has been actively pushing European countries, the US, and others to engage with the new Syria,” said Ozkan. “This decision creates a positive agenda among Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the United States — and clearly increases Türkiye’s diplomatic leverage in the region, especially in post-conflict scenarios.”

Türkiye now finds itself in a position of considerable influence—not just as a neighbour with shared borders but as a stabilising force and potential guarantor of the new Syrian order. “I see Türkiye as a guarantor—not in an official capacity, but effectively so,” Ozkan added. “In terms of security, reconstruction, and even business cooperation, Türkiye is set to take a big role.”

President Erdogan – during Tuesday’s meeting with Trump and bin Salman – expressed readiness to assist in Syria’s fight against Daesh and manage the security of prisons holding terrorists—a major confidence-building step for Washington and Gulf partners.

Sanctions relief: Opportunities and uncertainty

While the political breakthrough is clear, the economic implications are more complex. Ali Ahmadi, Executive Fellow at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP) and Director for Sanctions and Geoeconomics at London-based ReshapeRisk, offered a sobering analysis of the structural hurdles that lie ahead.

“President Trump can quickly remove sanctions imposed by Executive Order or agency policy,” Ahmadi told TRT World. “However, the strongest sanctions on Syria were imposed legislatively by Congress through the Caesar Act in 2020. The President may have some waiver authority that lifts them temporarily or slows their enforcement, but Congress would have to pass a bill to formally remove them.”

This legal ambiguity poses a risk to international investors and banks, many of whom have adopted a “wait-and-see” posture. “The example of Iran's sanctions relief after the 2015 nuclear deal is informative,” Ahmadi explained. “Some firms did enter the Iranian market, but banks hesitated due to a lack of clarity and compliance concerns.”

Nonetheless, Ahmadi foresees a burst of economic activity, especially in humanitarian and arms-length trade, driven in part by Gulf investments. “There was already GCC money in the Syrian financial system even when Assad was in power. There will be more now. But investments and banking relations will take time to restore.”

A shift in regional balance of power

The policy shift could also signal a reordering of influence in Syria, particularly with regard to Iran and Russia.

“In terms of regional power, it is clear that Iran is now on the sidelines,” said Ozkan. “For the first time in nearly a decade, there’s direct regional cooperation between the Gulf and Türkiye in shaping the region. Iran was once a major disruptive power; now it has been pushed out of the equation.”

Russia’s role, too, appears to be diminished. According to Ozkan, Moscow’s influence in Syria has become more limited, creating a strategic opening for Türkiye and its Gulf allies.

“From now on, Iraq, Syria, and others will try to align more with the Gulf and Türkiye rather than with Iran and Russia,” he said, predicting that other regional actors like Iraq and Jordan may now pivot closer to Ankara and Riyadh, reorienting the regional balance in their favour.

A pivotal turning point

Syria’s foreign ministry hailed the US move as a “pivotal turning point” that could restore stability and pave the way for normalised international relations. Celebrations broke out in central Damascus, where citizens gathered in Umayyad Square waving Syrian flags and chanting slogans of hope.

However, not all stakeholders are convinced. Israel, a key US ally, remains staunchly opposed to any normalisation with Damascus. Yet, as Ali Ahmadi points out, “The new Syrian government’s reported willingness to make unprecedented concessions to Israel resolves Netanyahu's objections to the relief of sanctions.”

Whether Syria can truly seize this “chance at greatness,” as Trump put it, will depend on more than American goodwill. It will require sustained regional cooperation, pragmatic diplomacy, and structural reforms within Syria’s economy and governance, analysts say.

Still, for the first time in over a decade, the prospect of a stable, reintegrated Syria is no longer a distant dream—it’s a work in progress, with Ankara and Riyadh leading the way and Washington recalibrating from behind, they add."

Speaking to TRT Haber before the NATO Informal Foreign Ministers Meeting began on Wednesday in Antalya, Fidan said the meeting will discuss preparations for the NATO Leaders Summit, which will be held in The Hague, Netherlands, in June, and that the fact that Türkiye is hosting the meeting adds to the importance of the talks.

One of the main issues on NATO's agenda is the determination of ""burden-sharing"" ratios, which the US has long opposed, Fidan pointed out, adding that US President Donald Trump has emphasised this issue both during his first and current terms.

He underlined that the European security architecture has also been significantly impacted, adding that both the EU and NATO have developed initiatives and new parameters for their member states.

He said the parameters and limits on defence spending, the lifting of sanctions and restrictions on defence cooperation between the allies, and the resolution of disputed areas are important agenda items.

Russia-Ukraine war, Gaza genocide on agenda

Fidan noted that the issue of ending the Russia-Ukraine war will also be on the agenda, adding, ""In addition, as Türkiye, we will informally and productively discuss all other issues, especially the war and genocide in Gaza, which are in our neighbouring region and directly affect transatlantic security.""

Regarding his meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte on Tuesday, Fidan said Rutte was also received by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and that the strategic framework of NATO-Türkiye relations was reiterated during the meeting.

He also met with Rutte over a working dinner, where the strategy outlined with Erdogan was thoroughly discussed, he said.

He said they discussed sensitive aspects of the alliance's common issues for Türkiye, NATO-Türkiye relations, and ties between NATO member countries and Türkiye.

""There are some issues that the NATO secretary general should be aware of and intervene in himself. We were allowed to explain them one by one. So, how will we follow these issues together? Which leader will we follow, and how will we discuss them? We also came to a general agreement on this issue. In short, it was an extremely productive meeting.""

Intense diplomatic activities in Istanbul

Responding to a question about the peace talks between Russia and Ukraine to be hosted by Türkiye in Istanbul, Fidan said, ""There is an incredibly intense diplomatic traffic right now.""

""Many parties are in talks with each other. There are talks planned for tomorrow in Istanbul. Some delegations have already been determined, and others are still being determined. The exact format is still not finalised,"" he added.

Türkiye has been working to end the war in Ukraine since its inception, said the foreign minister, emphasising that the country also wants the wars and tensions in Gaza, Africa, and the region to end, as well as permanent and lasting peace.

'I am a little more hopeful at this point'

Referring to the negotiations to be held in Istanbul, Fidan said: ""The American delegation is coming to Istanbul, the Russian delegation will come to Istanbul. I will meet again with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister (Andrii Sybiha) after I meet with you today. There is heavy traffic.""

He said the parties are currently attempting to harmonise their positions, adding, ""Obviously, we welcome this with understanding. Because everyone has their base to protect, the most important strategic goal for us is to establish a ceasefire as soon as possible and begin systematic peace negotiations. This is extremely important for our region.""

When asked whether they were optimistic about the negotiations, Fidan replied: ""I am a little more hopeful at this point. The intention of 'I want to stop this war' is important, but there are modalities, and trust must be established.

""It is difficult to establish trust when you leave the two parties alone. Therefore, credible and trustworthy actors with high credibility must be involved. Türkiye is unquestionably one of the leading actors.""

Trump's announcement to lift sanctions on Syria

In response to another question about Trump's announcement to lift sanctions on Syria, Fidan said there is a vision that guides Türkiye's efforts in Syria, citing his meetings with Erdogan.

He noted: ""The content of this vision is that not only Türkiye, but all stakeholders in the region should be involved in solving the Syrian issue and that the Europeans and Americans should play a positive role in this issue.""

Many countries in the region, particularly Saudi Arabia, are playing a positive role and are working in coordination with these countries, he said, adding that Syrian President Ahmad Alshaara and Foreign Minister al Shaibani are in close diplomatic contact and that the new administration's diplomacy is well-received around the world.

Fidan emphasised the importance of lifting the sanctions imposed under the ousted Bashar al Assad to ensure the return of the Syrian people and to revive the economy, and said Erdogan raised concerns about the war in Gaza and joint work to improve the situation in Syria in his talks with Trump.

Trump responded positively to Erdogan's request, he said. ""It is critical that Türkiye's constructive role in Syria is recognised. This is really a matter of trust. At the same time, the international community has imposed on us this responsibility.""

Fidan described the meeting between Türkiye, the US, Saudi Arabia, and Syria as ""historic"" and positive.

He explained that they will meet with Rubio and Shaibani on Thursday after the informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers. ""We will work on how to advance the details of the agreement that the leaders have drawn up and agreed on.""

Fidan said they expect investments in Syria to increase as soon as the sanctions are officially lifted."
5/14/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/0845f2a720ef,"‘A unique opportunity’: The lifting of US sanctions and what it means for SyriaUS President Donald Trump announced that the decades-long US sanctions regime on Syria will end soon, allowing the war-ravaged country to integrate into the international system.","During his three-day Middle East tour, US President Donald Trump announced that US sanctions on Damascus will be lifted. The news was met with celebrations as many Syrians took to the streets, honking their cars and waving flags across the country from the capital Damascus to Homs.

“The sanctions were brutal and crippling and served as an important — really an important function — nevertheless, at the time. But now it’s their time to shine,” said Trump, urging Syrian leadership to show something “very special.”

Syria had been under severe Western sanctions since 2011, the start of the country’s civil war, which displaced nearly half its population and killed more than 500,000 people under the former Assad regime.

Syria now has a chance to integrate into the international system following President Donald Trump’s groundbreaking decision to end the US embargo on the Middle Eastern country, says a senior adviser to a leading Turkish financial monitory authority, requesting anonymity as professional protocol.

“This is a historic moment. The lifting of sanctions was a rightful demand of the Syrian people who brought down the regime. These measures were originally imposed against the regime, and they should have been lifted with its fall,” says Omar Alhariri, a Daraa-based Syrian journalist.

Trump’s decision to lift Syria sanctions came during his high-profile Middle East tour, which included Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE. During his stop in Riyadh, Trump made a surprising move by meeting Syrian President Ahmed Alshaara. Since the Bill Clinton–Hafez al Assad meeting in 2000, no US president had met with a Syrian leader in the last 25 years.

Since the oust of the Baath regime in December 2024, Alsharaa has gained international legitimacy, marked by lifted US bounties and high-level meetings abroad. The government under Alsharaa has been positioning itself as moderate, distancing itself from extremist groups and promising cooperation on counterterrorism and minority rights.

Trump said that his decision on sanctions and the Alshaara meeting was encouraged by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

“Today, we stand before a unique opportunity, and there is a sense of excitement and hope as people look forward to shaping Syria’s future. It is also important to express deep gratitude to both Saudi Arabia and Türkiye for their significant roles in making this moment possible,” Alhariri tells TRT World.

In exchange for lifting sanctions on Syria, President Trump demanded that the Syrian president join the Abraham Accords, normalise relations with Israel, and deport foreign fighters and Palestinian groups from the country, the White House said.

“Will bring financial and social capital back”

A sanction-free Syria is “definitely a positive step” for this key Middle Eastern state, the adviser quoted above tells TRT World, adding that Trump’s decision will have “a signal impact” across the globe, leading many displaced citizens to return to their home countries, potentially contributing to the country’s economic growth.

From 2010 to 2023, under Western sanctions and amid civil war, Syria’s GDP is estimated to have contracted by 84 percent, as unemployment and poverty devastated the country. According to UN estimates, in 2022, nearly 90 percent of Syrians lived in poverty.

Mehmet Babacan, a professor of economics at Marmara University who has worked in various capacities involving Turkish central bank policies, sees many potential benefits in Trump’s decision to make Syria a sanction-free state in terms of the country’s financial system and future development.

Prior to Trump’s move, the UK and EU had removed some sanctions on Syria. Many expect the US president’s decision will lead to the dismantling of the broader international embargo on Damascus.

“The removal of the international embargo on Syria will facilitate the country’s access to international markets, helping address its debt obligations from the past and reestablish its ties with international organisations” like the World Bank, Babacan tells TRT World.

Among others, the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Islamic Development Bank can play a critical role in boosting economic growth and reconstruction efforts, according to Babacan.

In macroeconomic terms, a sanctions-free Syria’s currency will have a better future as the country will be able to get economic aid and credits from both international groups and foreign states, which can also have positive impacts on ensuring price stability in the long term, according to Babacan.

Beyond gaining access to international financial organisations like the IMF and World Bank, Syria can also work to reach bilateral trade agreements with other countries, says the Turkish economist. In this perspective, European states and Türkiye will have critical roles in improving Syria’s economic outlook, he adds.

“A demographic return to Syria will also have a multiplier positive effect on the country’s economic structure as many young Syrians left due to the civil war and political suppression under the Assad regime,” says Babacan.

“Their return means Syria’s deeper integration into regional states like Türkiye, home to the largest displaced Syrian population for over a decade, as well as Lebanon, Iraq, and European countries where substantial migration occurred during the war.”

This also brings their financial and social capital back into Syria, increasing investment and production in the war-torn nation, boosting both GDP and per capita income, says the professor.

With the news of Trump’s sanctions decision, the Syrian pound gained against the dollar."

“I think there is this window of opportunity this week, but also in the next 10 days, two weeks, to really bring the whole issue of Ukraine to a better place. Under the leadership, of course, of President (Volodymyr) Zelenskyy, but also very much steered by the American government. And Türkiye plays a big role here,” Rutte said on Wednesday, referring to Istanbul peace talks.

On the Eurofighter sale to Türkiye, Rutte said: “I encourage not imposing restrictions on arms sales by one ally on another. This should not happen within the alliance.”

He further underlined the importance of Türkiye's defence industry to NATO, saying: “The Turkish defence industry is crucial to the overall alliance.”

“For example, in Texas, there are factories producing ammunition. They could not have done that without the close cooperation of the companies here in Türkiye. This is just one of many examples.”

The NATO chief and foreign ministers gathered in Antalya, Türkiye, for an informal two-day meeting (the NATO iFMM), which is hosted by the Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.

It will provide a platform for additional consultations ahead of the NATO leaders’ summit set to be held in The Hague on June 24-25, diplomatic sources said.

This Thursday could mark a pivotal moment in global efforts to halt the Russia-Ukraine war as their leaders are expected to hold direct talks in the Turkish city of Istanbul.

The potentially historic meeting represents the most advanced stage of negotiations since the two sides were brought together in March 2022 by the same mediator, Türkiye, a reflection of the level of trust Ankara enjoys with both Russia and Ukraine.

This time, it was Russian President Vladimir Putin who proposed a meeting in Türkiye, making the announcement in a Sunday press conference as he countered Ukraine and European nations’ demand for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.

Turkish President Erdogan confirmed Ankara’s readiness to host the discussions in a phone call with Putin the same day, followed by US President Donald Trump urging Ukrainian leader Zelenskyy to “immediately” take up the Russian proposal for direct talks.

Within just a week, Türkiye has become a central player in several significant geopolitical crises from Europe, the Middle East to North Africa.

Through diplomacy, military influence, or mediation efforts, Erdogan has ensured that Türkiye plays a vital role in conversations about peace, conflict, and global stability.

Despite ongoing challenges, the developments of this week highlight a shift in Ankara’s foreign policy — one defined by strategic autonomy, regional assertiveness, and a more active global presence.

As Erdogan strengthens his influence across various arenas, Türkiye is increasingly asserting itself as a rising middle power with international impact."

From progress in talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the US, to the disbanding of the PKK terrorist organisation, Türkiye has demonstrated not only its regional influence but also its growing role as a global power broker.

Ukraine–Russia–US peace talks in Istanbul

The most closely watched development of the week is the announcement that senior representatives from Ukraine, Russia, and the United States will meet in Istanbul to explore pathways to end the conflict in Ukraine.

While a ceasefire has not yet been declared, the decision to hold high-level negotiations in Türkiye underscores Ankara’s credibility as a neutral facilitator between East and West — a role it has cultivated since the early days of the war.

On Tuesday, Zelenskyy told reporters in Kiev, Ukraine's capital, that he will meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday in Ankara, where they will both await the arrival of Russian President Vladimir Putin. If the Russian president decides to attend the meeting, the US officials announced that President Trump might also travel to Istanbul to take part in the peace talks..

On the same day, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte arrived in Türkiye, where he met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan ahead of an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers, scheduled to be held in Antalya from May 14 to 15.

Rutte’s visit centered on the Ukraine peace talks.

PKK disbands after decades of terrorism

One of the most significant national security breakthroughs came on Monday with the announcement that the PKK terrorist organisation has officially disbanded and laid down its arms. This marks a historic turning point in Türkiye’s decades-long counterterrorism campaign.

The group’s collapse is widely attributed to Türkiye’s successful strategy combining military modernisation, expanded surveillance via domestically produced drones, and sustained economic and social investment in southeastern provinces.

The move was met with muted reactions from Western governments but hailed domestically as a major victory for peace and stability.

Syria back on the table — Trump signals sanctions relief

In another significant development on Tuesday, US President Trump announced that the US would lift all sanctions on Syria, following his talks with President Erdogan.

The move, if enacted, could open the door for reconstruction efforts and regional reintegration, with Türkiye playing a central role in stabilising and rebuilding its southern neighbor.

This follows reports that Türkiye hosted backchannel discussions between the US and Syrian interlocutors, aiming to lower tensions and ease humanitarian crises in the region.

Iran–Europe and Hamas–Pakistan praise Ankara’s mediation

Türkiye’s diplomatic balancing act extended further with Iranian and European officials meeting in Ankara to resume stalled talks on nuclear de-escalation and trade normalisation. Talks between the delegation from Iran, the UK, France, and Germany will take place on Friday in Istanbul.

Though details remain scarce, the mere fact that Türkiye was chosen as the host speaks volumes about its perceived neutrality and reliability in complex negotiations.

In a symbolic gesture, both Palestinian resistance group Hamas and the government of Pakistan issued statements thanking President Erdogan for his role in facilitating humanitarian corridors and ceasefire discussions amid ongoing tensions in the Middle East and South Asia.

Stability returns to Libya with Türkiye-backed PM

In North Africa, Türkiye scored another strategic gain as Libya’s UN-recognised Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, backed by Ankara, solidified his political authority after overcoming internal dissent.

The development reaffirms Türkiye’s influence in shaping the post-conflict political landscape in Libya — a country where Ankara has invested heavily in both diplomacy and defence.

Week of diplomacy: Türkiye’s moment

In just one week, Türkiye has found itself at the heart of no fewer than six major geopolitical flashpoints.

Whether it is through mediation, military leverage, or diplomatic finesse, President Erdogan has positioned Türkiye as a country that cannot be ignored in discussions of peace, war, and global order.

While challenges remain, this week offers a glimpse of Ankara’s evolving foreign policy doctrine: strategic independence, regional leadership, and global engagement.

As Erdogan consolidates his role in multiple theaters, Türkiye appears to be stepping confidently into the role of a middle power with global reach."
5/13/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/40c04eb45483,Analysis: Trump’s outreach to Syria marks major policy shiftTrump’s reliance on regional heavyweights like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is a calculated move.,"The meeting between US President Donald Trump and Syrian President Ahmed Alsharaa would mark a “historic” and “very significant” moment in US-Syria relations, says TRT World Editor-at-Large Yusuf Erim.

“I had a feeling sooner or later Trump was going to reach out to the Syrian president Ahmed Alsharaa,” Erim said, calling it the first direct engagement between the two nations’ leaders in over 25 years.

“That in itself is historic,” he said, highlighting a major shift in Washington’s approach to the Middle East.

Erim said Trump is moving away from the proxy-based strategies of previous administrations and instead opting for direct regional influence through allies like Türkiye and Saudi Arabia.

“We’re seeing quite a restructuring of US policy in the Middle East and we’re seeing it most evidently in Syria,” he said.

Reflecting on the last decade of US involvement in Syria, Erim was critical of the Obama-era policies, which he said were largely inherited by both Trump’s first administration and the Biden presidency.

“America was working more with proxies in the region. Some of those proxies [were] very hostile to its NATO ally Türkiye, most namely the YPG,” he said, contrasting that with Türkiye’s proactive support for the Syrian opposition, which culminated in the rise of Alsharaa.

Trump’s reliance on regional heavyweights like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is a calculated move, Erim said.

“Trump is smart enough to say, ‘Hey, I need that local know-how, I need that local influence, and I have two allies who can really impact Syria. Let me work with them here’.”

The lifting of sanctions on Syria has been another game-changing move, Erim said. “It’s a fresh start for Syria with a fresh administration, a fresh mindset and a society that wants to move forward from its past.”

Beyond Syria, Erim said Trump is aiming to take a more balanced role in other regional flashpoints, including Lebanon and Gaza.

“Trump has shown that he will try to be as just as possible. He will try to be as neutral as possible,” he said, pointing to the cool distance in Trump’s relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as evidence of a more measured US stance.

“The most important [thing] will be how the US sits at the table with Israel ... being able to bring Israel back from this brink of war, regional war, back to the diplomatic table and say, ‘Hey, listen, we need to find a resolution on Gaza, we need to stop this cross-border bombing with Lebanon, we need some form of normalisation’.”

Erim also suggested that Trump’s broader regional ambitions could include a revival of the Abraham Accords. “I think Trump’s real desire is to return back to the Abraham Accords, which is a possibility, but not at the current dynamics, not with the current atmosphere—that needs to change.”

Erim further pointed to growing US-Türkiye cooperation beyond the Middle East, referencing an expected high-level Ukraine-Russia meeting in Istanbul.

“We’re seeing a golden age right now for US-Türkiye relations,” he said, crediting the personal rapport between Trump and Erdogan for unlocking progress on long-stalled global issues."
5/14/2025 0:00,Politics,https://trt.global/world/article/f55cd231a0fd,"The end of the PKK: What led to the terror group's dissolution after decades of bloodshedFrom drones to diplomacy, Türkiye’s multi-front strategy has dismantled the PKK’s power and ended its decades-long terrorism — not just through force, but by changing the conditions that allowed terror to take root.","After nearly four decades of bloodshed and violence, the PKK, a group designated as a terrorist organisation by Türkiye, the United States, and the European Union, has formally declared its dissolution and the laying down of arms.

The announcement on Monday brings to a close one of the bloodiest chapters in modern Türkiye’s history, one marked by tens of thousands of deaths, devastated communities, and a national security challenge that spanned generations.

But the decision did not come out of nowhere. It is the result of a long and complex evolution—one that reflects not only Türkiye’s relentless counterterrorism efforts but also its transformation as a nation. A new military doctrine, cutting-edge defence technology, smart intelligence coordination, diplomatic assertiveness, and targeted investments in underdeveloped regions all played a role.

Relentless military pressure and modernised tactics

At the heart of Türkiye’s victory over the PKK is a remarkable military transformation. In the past, the country’s fight against terrorism relied heavily on ground troops and fixed strategies, often in treacherous terrain and with limited technological advantages. That began to change in the 2010s, as Türkiye launched a massive overhaul of its armed forces. The rise of the domestic defence industry allowed Türkiye to manufacture its own drones, guided munitions, surveillance systems, and secure communication technologies.

By the early 2020s, Turkish-made unmanned aerial vehicles—most notably the Anka, Bayraktar TB2 and later the more advanced Akinci—were regularly used to identify and eliminate PKK terrorist targets in remote mountain regions, both within Türkiye and across the Iraqi border. Combined with the establishment of permanent military outposts high in the southeastern mountains, supported by surveillance and long-range strike capability, the PKK’s traditional areas of control became increasingly inaccessible. The group that once used mobility and secrecy as its strongest assets now found itself visible, vulnerable, and increasingly isolated.

But firepower alone was not enough. Behind the scenes, Türkiye’s National Intelligence Organization (MİT) led a quiet revolution in the state’s capacity to wage information warfare. Real-time coordination between intelligence and military forces allowed for surgical operations that dismantled the PKK’s leadership and logistical networks. High-ranking operatives were systematically eliminated or captured. PKK's so-called safe havens raided. Cross-border operations, once controversial, became a regular and highly effective tactic.

Meanwhile, the Turkish state expanded its war on terror to the diplomatic arena. Years of steady pressure on international partners—especially in Europe and the Middle East—began to pay off.

The PKK’s ability to operate freely in foreign capitals, launder money, and fundraise under various political covers diminished significantly. Türkiye’s growing geopolitical clout meant its concerns were increasingly taken seriously by global powers.

Through economic ties, energy diplomacy, and regional partnerships, Ankara slowly choked off the PKK’s support networks abroad.

Socioeconomic investments in the southeast

However, what truly turned the tide was the government’s strategic investment in the very region the PKK had long claimed to represent. Throughout the 2010s and 2020s, southeastern Türkiye saw an unprecedented wave of development. Crumbling roads gave way to highways.

Remote villages gained access to healthcare and education. Local industries received incentives to grow. New universities opened their doors to students who, in a previous generation, might have seen no future beyond joining the insurgency. Urban renewal projects, job creation programs, and expanded cultural freedoms changed the social fabric of cities like Diyarbakir, Mardin, and Sirnak.

In parallel, the population of the region—especially the younger generation—began to turn away from the narrative of violence. With better education, greater economic opportunity, and growing civic engagement, the PKK’s message began to sound increasingly hollow.

What had once been framed as a struggle for rights and recognition was now seen by many as an obstacle to progress and peace. The group’s violent methods were increasingly viewed as incompatible with the aspirations of a new generation that wanted to be part of a modern, democratic Türkiye.

In this changing context, the PKK’s long-standing attempt to act as both a military and political actor began to fail. Its political offshoots lost credibility, particularly when their ties to violence became more difficult to explain. Simultaneously, its armed wing grew increasingly fragmented, with leaders defecting, fighters surrendering, and local support drying up.

The Middle East is changing—and so did the PKK’s strategic value

The broader regional picture also shifted. The end of major hostilities in Syria and the slow stabilisation of Iraq left less room for militant groups to maneuver. Türkiye’s deepening ties with Iraq’s central government and the Kurdish Regional Government in the North led to coordinated operations against PKK camps in the mountains. Once considered safe havens, these areas became high-risk zones for PKK activity. With no territory to govern, no safe rear base, and dwindling recruitment, the terror group’s operational capacity shrank to a shadow of what it once was.

By 2025, the PKK was no longer the organisation that had once paralysed Türkiye with fear. It was a diminished and demoralised remnant, clinging to outdated ideology and vanishing influence. Its announcement of dissolution, while historic, was in many ways a recognition of defeat—a reluctant acknowledgment that the struggle it once led had no place in the Türkiye of today.

A strategic victory years in the making

The Turkish government has responded cautiously but resolutely. Officials have praised the outcome as a victory for the nation, while also emphasising the need for vigilance. President Erdogan, in a recent address, hailed the dissolution as a testament to Türkiye’s unity and resolve.

“This is not only a military triumph,” he said, “but a triumph of our people’s will to live in peace and dignity, side by side, without fear.”

Indeed, the end of the PKK terror group is not just a story about defeating terrorism—it is a story about transformation.

Through strategic persistence, technological advancement, and social inclusion, Türkiye managed to close a violent chapter in its history.

Whether the peace that follows will be lasting depends not only on security policy, but on continuing to build a state that all its citizens feel invested in.

For now, however, one thing is clear: what once seemed impossible is now real. The PKK is over. And with it, a nation wounded by decades of terror begins to heal."

Speaking at a Gulf-US summit in the Saudi capital Riyadh, Trump said the decision came after talking with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

“After discussing the situation with Crown Prince Mohammed and President Erdogan of Türkiye, I'm also ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria to give them a fresh start. It gives (Syria) a chance for greatness,"" he said.

Turkish President Erdogan said the US president's decision to lift sanctions on Syria carries historic importance.

During the meeting, Erdogan expressed Ankara’s desire for Syria to be a stable, prosperous nation that collaborates with its regional neighbours and poses no threat to them, citing Türkiye's ongoing efforts to achieve this goal.

Erdogan also affirmed Türkiye's continued support for Damascus’ fight against terrorist groups, particularly Daesh. He added that Türkiye is ready to assist in managing and securing prisons holding Daesh terrorists.

Trump, in Riyadh on the first state visit of his second term, also became the first US president in 25 years to meet a Syrian leader.

Trump and Ahmed Alsharaa held brief talks ahead of a larger gathering of Gulf leaders in Saudi Arabia during Trump's tour of the region, a White House official said.

No US president has met a Syrian leader since Bill Clinton saw Hafez al Assad, Bashar's father, in Geneva in 2000.

Trump announced on Tuesday that he was lifting ""brutal and crippling"" Assad-era sanctions on Syria in response to demands from Alsharaa's allies in Türkiye and Saudi Arabia—in his latest step out of tune with US ally Israel.

Israel has opposed sanctions relief for Syria, but Trump on Tuesday said that bin Salman and Erdogan encouraged him to make the move.

Trump said it was Syrians' ""time to shine"" and that easing sanctions would ""give them a chance at greatness"".

Syrians celebrated the news, with dozens of men, women and children gathering in Damascus's Umayyad Square.

The Syrian foreign ministry called Trump's decision a ""pivotal turning point"" that would help bring stability.

Trump’s first day of a four-day swing through the Gulf region was marked by lavish ceremony and business deals, including a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in US arms sales to the kingdom.

Later on Wednesday, Trump will fly to Qatari capital Doha, where he will participate in a state visit with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani and other officials.

Qatar, a key US ally, is expected to announce hundreds of billions of dollars in investments in the US.

Following his visit to Qatar, Trump will fly to Abu Dhabi to meet with the UAE's leaders on Thursday.

He is then slated to fly back to Washington on Friday, but he has said he could fly to Türkiye instead for a potential meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy."

Zelenskyy on Monday reiterated his commitment to diplomacy and confirmed his readiness to attend proposed peace talks in Türkiye, calling on Russia to respond to international efforts for a ceasefire.

“Ukraine has always supported diplomacy. I am ready to come to Türkiye,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X. “Unfortunately, the world still has not received a clear response from Russia to the numerous proposals for a ceasefire.”

In response to a question about whether European representatives might have a seat at the negotiating table on the Ukrainian settlement, Peskov criticised Europe's stance, saying it sharply contrasts with that of Moscow and Washington.
